<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Philip Sidney</span> was born at
Penshurst, in Kent, on the 29th of November, 1554.&nbsp; His
father, Sir Henry Sidney, had married Mary, eldest daughter of
John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, and Philip was the eldest of
their family of three sons and four daughters.&nbsp; Edmund
Spenser and Walter Raleigh were of like age with Philip Sidney,
differing only by about a year, and when Elizabeth became queen,
on the 17th of November, 1558, they were children of four or five
years old.</p>
<p>In the year 1560 Sir Henry Sidney was made Lord President of
Wales, representing the Queen in Wales and the four adjacent
western counties, as a Lord Deputy represented her in
Ireland.&nbsp; The official residence of the Lord President was
at Ludlow Castle, to which Philip Sidney went with his family
when a child of six.&nbsp; In the same year his father was
installed as a Knight of the Garter.&nbsp; When in his tenth year
Philip Sidney was sent from Ludlow to Shrewsbury Grammar School,
where he studied for three or four years, and had among his
schoolfellows Fulke Greville, afterwards Lord Brooke, who
remained until the end of Sidney&rsquo;s life one of his closest
friends.&nbsp; When he himself was dying he directed that he
should be described upon his tomb as &ldquo;Fulke Greville,
servant to Queen Elizabeth, counsellor to King James, and friend
to Sir Philip Sidney.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Dr. Thomas Thornton,
Canon of Christ Church, Oxford, under whom Sidney was placed when
he was entered to Christ Church in his fourteenth year, at
Midsummer, in 1568, had it afterwards recorded on his tomb that
he was &ldquo;the tutor of Sir Philip Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney was in his eighteenth year in May, 1572, when he left
the University to continue his training for the service of the
state, by travel on the Continent.&nbsp; Licensed to travel with
horses for himself and three servants, Philip Sidney left London
in the train of the Earl of Lincoln, who was going out as
ambassador to Charles IX., in Paris.&nbsp; He was in Paris on the
24th of August in that year, which was the day of the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew.&nbsp; He was sheltered from the dangers of that
day in the house of the English Ambassador, Sir Francis
Walsingham, whose daughter Fanny Sidney married twelve years
afterwards.</p>
<p>From Paris Sidney travelled on by way of Heidelberg to
Frankfort, where he lodged at a printer&rsquo;s, and found a warm
friend in Hubert Languet, whose letters to him have been
published.&nbsp; Sidney was eighteen and Languet fifty-five, a
French Huguenot, learned and zealous for the Protestant cause,
who had been Professor of Civil Law in Padua, and who was acting
as secret minister for the Elector of Saxony when he first knew
Sidney, and saw in him a future statesman whose character and
genius would give him weight in the counsels of England, and make
him a main hope of the Protestant cause in Europe.&nbsp; Sidney
travelled on with Hubert Languet from Frankfort to Vienna,
visited Hungary, then passed to Italy, making for eight weeks
Venice his head-quarters, and then giving six weeks to
Padua.&nbsp; He returned through Germany to England, and was in
attendance it the Court of Queen Elizabeth in July, 1575.&nbsp;
Next month his father was sent to Ireland as Lord Deputy, and
Sidney lived in London with his mother.</p>
<p>At this time the opposition of the Mayor and Corporation of
the City of London to the acting of plays by servants of
Sidney&rsquo;s uncle, the Earl of Leicester, who had obtained a
patent for them, obliged the actors to cease from hiring rooms or
inn yards in the City, and build themselves a house of their own
a little way outside one of the City gates, and wholly outside
the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&nbsp; Thus the first theatre
came to be built in England in the year 1576.&nbsp; Shakespeare
was then but twelve years old, and it was ten years later that he
came to London.</p>
<p>In February, 1577, Philip Sidney, not yet twenty-three years
old, was sent on a formal embassy of congratulation to Rudolph
II. upon his becoming Emperor of Germany, but under the duties of
the formal embassy was the charge of watching for opportunities
of helping forward a Protestant League among the princes of
Germany.&nbsp; On his way home through the Netherlands he was to
convey Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s congratulations to William of
Orange on the birth of his first child, and what impression he
made upon that leader of men is shown by a message William sent
afterwards through Fulke Greville to Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; He
said &ldquo;that if he could judge, her Majesty had one of the
ripest and greatest counsellors of State in Philip Sidney that
then lived in Europe; to the trial of which he was pleased to
leave his own credit engaged until her Majesty was pleased to
employ this gentleman, either amongst her friends or
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney returned from his embassy in June, 1577.&nbsp; At the
time of his departure, in the preceding February, his sister
Mary, then twenty years old, had become the third wife of Henry
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and her new home as Countess of
Pembroke was in the great house at Wilton, about three miles from
Salisbury.&nbsp; She had a measure of her brother&rsquo;s genius,
and was of like noble strain.&nbsp; Spenser described her as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gentlest shepherdess that lives this
day,<br />
And most resembling, both in shape and spright,<br />
Her brother dear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben Jonson, long after her brother had passed from earth,
wrote upon her death the well-known epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Underneath this sable herse<br />
Lies the subject of all verse,<br />
Sidney&rsquo;s sister, Pembroke&rsquo;s mother.<br />
Death, ere thou hast slain another,<br />
Learn&rsquo;d, and fair, and good as she,<br />
Time shall throw a dart at thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidney&rsquo;s sister became Pembroke&rsquo;s mother in 1580,
while her brother Philip was staying with her at Wilton.&nbsp; He
had early in the year written a long argument to the Queen
against the project of her marriage with the Duke of Anjou, which
she then found it politic to seem to favour.&nbsp; She liked
Sidney well, but resented, or appeared to resent, his intrusion
of advice; he also was discontented with what seemed to be her
policy, and he withdrew from Court for a time.&nbsp; That time of
seclusion, after the end of March, 1580, he spent with his sister
at Wilton.&nbsp; They versified psalms together; and he began to
write for her amusement when she had her baby first upon her
hands, his romance of &ldquo;Arcadia.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was never
finished.&nbsp; Much was written at Wilton in the summer of 1580,
the rest in 1581, written, as he said in a letter to her,
&ldquo;only for you, only to you . . . for severer eyes it is
not, being but a trifle, triflingly handled.&nbsp; Your dear self
can best witness the manner, being done in loose sheets of paper,
most of it in your presence, the rest by sheets sent unto you as
fast as they were done.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never meant that it
should be published; indeed, when dying he asked that it should
be destroyed; but it belonged to a sister who prized the lightest
word of his, and after his death it was published in 1590 as
&ldquo;The Countess of Pembroke&rsquo;s Arcadia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book reprinted in this volume was written in 1581, while
sheets of the &ldquo;Arcadia&rdquo; were still being sent to
Wilton.&nbsp; But it differs wholly in style from the
&ldquo;Arcadia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sidney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arcadia&rdquo;
has literary interest as the first important example of the union
of pastoral with heroic romance, out of which came presently, in
France, a distinct school of fiction.&nbsp; But the genius of its
author was at play, it followed designedly the fashions of the
hour in verse and prose, which tended to extravagance of
ingenuity.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Defence of Poesy&rdquo; has higher
interest as the first important piece of literary criticism in
our literature.&nbsp; Here Sidney was in earnest.&nbsp; His style
is wholly free from the euphuistic extravagance in which readers
of his time delighted: it is clear, direct, and manly; not the
less, but the more, thoughtful and refined for its unaffected
simplicity.&nbsp; As criticism it is of the true sort; not
captious or formal, still less engaged, as nearly all bad
criticism is, more or less, with indirect suggestion of the
critic himself as the one owl in a world of mice.&nbsp; Philip
Sidney&rsquo;s care is towards the end of good literature.&nbsp;
He looks for highest aims, and finds them in true work, and hears
God&rsquo;s angel in the poet&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>The writing of this piece was probably suggested to him by the
fact that an earnest young student, Stephen Gosson, who came from
his university about the time when the first theatres were built,
and wrote plays, was turned by the bias of his mind into
agreement with the Puritan attacks made by the pulpit on the
stage (arising chiefly from the fact that plays were then acted
on Sundays), and in 1579 transferred his pen from service of the
players to attack on them, in a piece which he called &ldquo;The
School of Abuse, containing a Pleasant Invective against Poets,
Pipers, Players, Jesters, and such like Caterpillars of a
Commonwealth; setting up the Flag of Defiance to their
mischievous exercise, and overthrowing their Bulwarks, by Profane
Writers, Natural Reason, and Common Experience: a Discourse as
pleasant for Gentlemen that favour Learning as profitable for all
that will follow Virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Discourse Gosson
dedicated &ldquo;To the right noble Gentleman, Master Philip
Sidney, Esquire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sidney himself wrote verse, he was
companion with the poets, and counted Edmund Spenser among his
friends.&nbsp; Gosson&rsquo;s pamphlet was only one expression of
the narrow form of Puritan opinion that had been misled into
attacks on poetry and music as feeders of idle appetite that
withdrew men from the life of duty.&nbsp; To show the fallacy in
such opinion, Philip Sidney wrote in 1581 this piece, which was
first printed in 1595, nine years after his death, as a separate
publication, entitled &ldquo;An Apologie for
Poetrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three years afterwards it was added, with
other pieces, to the third edition of his &ldquo;Arcadia,&rdquo;
and then entitled &ldquo;The Defence of Poesie.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
sixteen subsequent editions it continued to appear as &ldquo;The
Defence of Poesie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same title was used in the
separate editions of 1752 and 1810.&nbsp; Professor Edward Arber
re-issued in 1869 the text of the first edition of 1595, and
restored the original title, which probably was that given to the
piece by its author.&nbsp; One name is as good as the other, but
as the word &ldquo;apology&rdquo; has somewhat changed its sense
in current English, it may be well to go on calling the work
&ldquo;The Defence of Poesie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1583 Sidney was knighted, and soon afterwards in the same
year he married Frances, daughter of Sir Francis
Walsingham.&nbsp; Sonnets written by him according to old
fashion, and addressed to a lady in accordance with a form of
courtesy that in the same old fashion had always been held to
exclude personal suit&mdash;personal suit was private, and not
public&mdash;have led to grave misapprehension among some
critics.&nbsp; They supposed that he desired marriage with
Penelope Devereux, who was forced by her family in
1580&mdash;then eighteen years old&mdash;into a hateful marriage
with Lord Rich.&nbsp; It may be enough to say that if Philip
Sidney had desired her for his wife, he had only to ask for her
and have her.&nbsp; Her father, when dying, had desired&mdash;as
any father might&mdash;that his daughter might become the wife of
Philip Sidney.&nbsp; But this is not the place for a discussion
of Astrophel and Stella sonnets.</p>
<p>In 1585 Sidney was planning to join Drake it sea in attack on
Spain in the West Indies.&nbsp; He was stayed by the Queen.&nbsp;
But when Elizabeth declared war on behalf of the Reformed Faith,
and sent Leicester with an expedition to the Netherlands, Sir
Philip Sidney went out, in November, 1585, as Governor of
Flushing.&nbsp; His wife joined him there.&nbsp; He fretted at
inaction, and made the value of his counsels so distinct that his
uncle Leicester said after his death that he began by
&ldquo;despising his youth for a counsellor, not without bearing
a hand over him as a forward young man.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, in
a short time he saw the sun so risen above his horizon that both
he and all his stars were glad to fetch light from
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In May, 1586, Sir Philip Sidney received news
of the death of his father.&nbsp; In August his mother
died.&nbsp; In September he joined in the investment of
Zutphen.&nbsp; On the 22nd of September his thigh-bone was
shattered by a musket ball from the trenches.&nbsp; His horse
took fright and galloped back, but the wounded man held to his
seat.&nbsp; He was then carried to his uncle, asked for water,
and when it was given, saw a dying soldier carried past, who eyed
it greedily.&nbsp; At once he gave the water to the soldier,
saying, &ldquo;Thy necessity is yet greater than
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sidney lived on, patient in suffering, until
the 17th of October.&nbsp; When he was speechless before death,
one who stood by asked Philip Sidney for a sign of his continued
trust in God.&nbsp; He folded his hands as in prayer over his
breast, and so they were become fixed and chill, when the
watchers placed them by his side; and in a few minutes the
stainless representative of the young manhood of Elizabethan
England passed away.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">An Apologie For Poetrie</span>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the right virtuous Edward
Wotton <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> and I were at the Emperor&rsquo;s court
together, we gave ourselves to learn horsemanship of Gio. Pietro
Pugliano; one that, with great commendation, had the place of an
esquire in his stable; and he, according to the fertileness of
the Italian wit, did not only afford us the demonstration of his
practice, but sought to enrich our minds with the contemplation
therein, which he thought most precious.&nbsp; But with none, I
remember, mine ears were at any time more laden, than when
(either angered with slow payment, or moved with our learner-like
admiration) he exercised his speech in the praise of his
faculty.</p>
<p>He said, soldiers were the noblest estate of mankind, and
horsemen the noblest of soldiers.&nbsp; He said, they were the
masters of war and ornaments of peace, speedy goers, and strong
abiders, triumphers both in camps and courts; nay, to so
unbelieved a point he proceeded, as that no earthly thing bred
such wonder to a prince, as to be a good horseman; skill of
government was but a &ldquo;pedanteria&rdquo; in
comparison.&nbsp; Then would he add certain praises by telling
what a peerless beast the horse was, the only serviceable
courtier, without flattery, the beast of most beauty,
faithfulness, courage, and such more, that if I had not been a
piece of a logician before I came to him, I think he would have
persuaded me to have wished myself a horse.&nbsp; But thus much,
at least, with his no few words, he drove into me, that self love
is better than any gilding, to make that seem gorgeous wherein
ourselves be parties.</p>
<p>Wherein, if Pugliano&rsquo;s strong affection and weak
arguments will not satisfy you, I will give you a nearer example
of myself, who, I know not by what mischance, in these my not old
years and idlest times, having slipped into the title of a poet,
am provoked to say something unto you in the defence of that my
unelected vocation; which if I handle with more good will than
good reasons, bear with me, since the scholar is to be pardoned
that followeth the steps of his master.</p>
<p>And yet I must say, that as I have more just cause to make a
pitiful defence of poor poetry, which, from almost the highest
estimation of learning, is fallen to be the laughing-stock of
children; so have I need to bring some more available proofs,
since the former is by no man barred of his deserved credit,
whereas the silly latter hath had even the names of philosophers
used to the defacing of it, with great danger of civil war among
the Muses. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a></p>
<p>At first, truly, to all them that, professing learning,
inveigh against poetry, may justly be objected, that they go very
near to ungratefulness to seek to deface that which, in the
noblest nations and languages that are known, hath been the first
light-giver to ignorance, and first nurse, whose milk by little
and little enabled them to feed afterwards of tougher
knowledges.&nbsp; And will you play the hedgehog, that being
received into the den, drove out his host? <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> or rather the vipers, that with their
birth kill their parents? <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p>Let learned Greece, in any of her manifold sciences, be able
to show me one book before Mus&aelig;us, Homer, and Hesiod, all
three nothing else but poets.&nbsp; Nay, let any history he
brought that can say any writers were there before them, if they
were not men of the same skill, as Orpheus, Linus, and some
others are named, who having been the first of that country that
made pens deliverers of their knowledge to posterity, may justly
challenge to be called their fathers in learning.&nbsp; For not
only in time they had this priority (although in itself antiquity
be venerable) but went before them as causes to draw with their
charming sweetness the wild untamed wits to an admiration of
knowledge.&nbsp; So as Amphion was said to move stones with his
poetry to build Thebes, and Orpheus to be listened to by beasts,
indeed, stony and beastly people, so among the Romans were Livius
Andronicus, and Ennius; so in the Italian language, the first
that made it to aspire to be a treasure-house of science, were
the poets Dante, Boccace, and Petrarch; so in our English were
Gower and Chaucer; after whom, encouraged and delighted with
their excellent foregoing, others have followed to beautify our
mother tongue, as well in the same kind as other arts.</p>
<p>This <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> did so notably show itself that the
philosophers of Greece durst not a long time appear to the world
but under the mask of poets; so Thales, Empedocles, and
Parmenides sang their natural philosophy in verses; so did
Pythagoras and Phocylides their moral counsels; so did
Tyrt&aelig;us in war matters; and Solon in matters of policy; or
rather they, being poets, did exercise their delightful vein in
those points of highest knowledge, which before them lay hidden
to the world; for that wise Solon was directly a poet it is
manifest, having written in verse the notable fable of the
Atlantic Island, which was continued by Plato. <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; And, truly, even Plato, whosoever
well considereth shall find that in the body of his work, though
the inside and strength were philosophy, the skin, as it were,
and beauty depended most of poetry.&nbsp; For all stands upon
dialogues; wherein he feigns many honest burgesses of Athens
speaking of such matters that if they had been set on the rack
they would never have confessed them; besides, his poetical
describing the circumstances of their meetings, as the
well-ordering of a banquet, the delicacy of a walk, with
interlacing mere tiles, as Gyges&rsquo;s Ring, <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> and others; which, who knows not to be
flowers of poetry, did never walk into Apollo&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>And <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> even historiographers, although their
lips sound of things done, and verity be written in their
foreheads, have been glad to borrow both fashion and, perchance,
weight of the poets; so Herodotus entitled the books of his
history by the names of the Nine Muses; and both he, and all the
rest that followed him, either stole or usurped, of poetry, their
passionate describing of passions, the many particularities of
battles which no man could affirm; or, if that be denied me, long
orations, put in the months of great kings and captains, which it
is certain they never pronounced.</p>
<p>So that, truly, neither philosopher nor historiographer could,
at the first, have entered into the gates of popular judgments,
if they had not taken a great disport of poetry; which in all
nations, at this day, where learning flourisheth not, is plain to
be seen; in all which they have some feeling of poetry.&nbsp; In
Turkey, besides their lawgiving divines they have no other
writers but poets.&nbsp; In our neighbour-country Ireland, where,
too, learning goes very bare, yet are their poets held in a
devout reverence.&nbsp; Even among the most barbarous and simple
Indians, where no writing is, yet have they their poets who make
and sing songs, which they call &ldquo;Arentos,&rdquo; both of
their ancestor&rsquo;s deeds and praises of their gods.&nbsp; A
sufficient probability, that if ever learning comes among them,
it must be by having their hard dull wits softened and sharpened
with the sweet delight of poetry; for until they find a pleasure
in the exercise of the mind, great promises of much knowledge
will little persuade them that know not the fruits of
knowledge.&nbsp; In Wales, the true remnant of the ancient
Britons, as there are good authorities to show the long time they
had poets, which they called bards, so through all the conquests
of Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, some of whom did seek to
ruin all memory of learning from among them, yet do their poets,
even to this day, last; so as it is not more notable in the soon
beginning than in long-continuing.</p>
<p>But since the authors of most of our sciences were the Romans,
and before them the Greeks, let us, a little, stand upon their
authorities; but even so far, as to see what names they have
given unto this now scorned skill. <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; Among the Romans
a poet was called &ldquo;vates,&rdquo; which is as much as a
diviner, foreseer, or prophet, as by his conjoined words
&ldquo;vaticinium,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaticinari,&rdquo; is
manifest; so heavenly a title did that excellent people bestow
upon this heart-ravishing knowledge!&nbsp; And so far were they
carried into the admiration thereof, that they thought in the
changeable hitting upon any such verses, great foretokens of
their following fortunes were placed.&nbsp; Whereupon grew the
word of sortes Virgilian&aelig;; when, by sudden opening
Virgil&rsquo;s book, they lighted upon some verse, as it is
reported by many, whereof the histories of the Emperors&rsquo;
lives are full.&nbsp; As of Albinus, the governor of our island,
who, in his childhood, met with this verse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Arma amens capio, nec sat rationis in armis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in his age performed it.&nbsp; Although it were a very
vain and godless superstition; as also it was, to think spirits
were commanded by such verses; whereupon this word charms,
derived of &ldquo;carmina,&rdquo; cometh, so yet serveth it to
show the great reverence those wits were held in; and altogether
not without ground, since both the oracles of Delphi and the
Sibyl&rsquo;s prophecies were wholly delivered in verses; for
that same exquisite observing of number and measure in the words,
and that high-flying liberty of conceit proper to the poet, did
seem to have some divine force in it.</p>
<p>And <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> may not I presume a little farther to
show the reasonableness of this word &ldquo;vates,&rdquo; and
say, that the holy David&rsquo;s Psalms are a divine poem?&nbsp;
If I do, I shall not do it without the testimony of great learned
men, both ancient and modern.&nbsp; But even the name of Psalms
will speak for me, which, being interpreted, is nothing but
Songs; then, that is fully written in metre, as all learned
Hebricians agree, although the rules be not yet fully
found.&nbsp; Lastly, and principally, his handling his prophecy,
which is merely poetical.&nbsp; For what else is the awaking his
musical instruments; the often and free changing of persons; his
notable prosopopoeias, when he maketh you, as it were, see God
coming in His majesty; his telling of the beasts&rsquo;
joyfulness, and hills leaping; but a heavenly poesy, wherein,
almost, he sheweth himself a passionate lover of that unspeakable
and everlasting beauty, to be seen by the eyes of the mind, only
cleared by faith?&nbsp; But truly, now, having named him, I fear
I seem to profane that holy name, applying it to poetry, which
is, among us, thrown down to so ridiculous an estimation.&nbsp;
But they that, with quiet judgments, will look a little deeper
into it, shall find the end and working of it such, as, being
rightly applied, deserveth not to be scourged out of the church
of God.</p>
<p>But <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> now let us see how the Greeks have
named it, and how they deemed of it.&nbsp; The Greeks named him
&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#8052;&nu;, which name hath, as the
most excellent, gone through other languages; it cometh of this
word &pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&#8054;&nu;, which is <i>to
make</i>; wherein, I know not whether by luck or wisdom, we
Englishmen have met with the Greeks in calling him &ldquo;a
maker,&rdquo; which name, how high and incomparable a title it
is, I had rather were known by marking the scope of other
sciences, than by any partial allegation.&nbsp; There is no art
delivered unto mankind that hath not the works of nature for his
principal object, without which they could not consist, and on
which they so depend as they become actors and players, as it
were, of what nature will have set forth. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; So doth the astronomer look upon
the stars, and by that he seeth set down what order nature hath
taken therein.&nbsp; So doth the geometrician and arithmetician,
in their diverse sorts of quantities.&nbsp; So doth the musician,
in times, tell you which by nature agree, which not.&nbsp; The
natural philosopher thereon hath his name; and the moral
philosopher standeth upon the natural virtues, vices, or passions
of man; and follow nature, saith he, therein, and thou shalt not
err.&nbsp; The lawyer saith what men have determined.&nbsp; The
historian, what men have done.&nbsp; The grammarian speaketh only
of the rules of speech; and the rhetorician and logician,
considering what in nature will soonest prove and persuade,
thereon give artificial rules, which still are compassed within
the circle of a question, according to the proposed matter.&nbsp;
The physician weigheth the nature of man&rsquo;s body, and the
nature of things helpful and hurtful unto it.&nbsp; And the
metaphysic, though it be in the second and abstract notions, and
therefore be counted supernatural, yet doth he, indeed, build
upon the depth of nature.&nbsp; Only the poet, disdaining to be
tied to any such subjection, lifted up with the vigour of his own
invention, doth grow, in effect, into another nature; in making
things either better than nature bringeth forth, or quite anew;
forms such as never were in nature, as the heroes, demi-gods,
Cyclops, chimeras, furies, and such like; so as he goeth hand in
hand with Nature, not enclosed within the narrow warrant of her
gifts, but freely ranging within the zodiac of his own wit. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature never set forth the
earth in so rich tapestry as divers poets have done; neither with
so pleasant rivers, fruitful trees, sweet-smelling flowers, nor
whatsoever else may make the too-much-loved earth more lovely;
her world is brazen, the poets only deliver a golden.</p>
<p>But let those things alone, and go to man; <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> for whom as the other things are, so it
seemeth in him her uttermost cunning is employed; and know,
whether she have brought forth so true a lover as Theagenes; so
constant a friend as Pylades; so valiant a man as Orlando; so
right a prince as Xenophon&rsquo;s Cyrus; and so excellent a man
every way as Virgil&rsquo;s &AElig;neas?&nbsp; Neither let this
be jestingly conceived, because the works of the one be
essential, the other in imitation or fiction; for every
understanding knoweth the skill of each artificer standeth in
that idea, or fore-conceit of the work, and not in the work
itself.&nbsp; And that the poet hath that idea is manifest by
delivering them forth in such excellency as he had imagined them;
which delivering forth, also, is not wholly imaginative, as we
are wont to say by them that build castles in the air; but so far
substantially it worketh not only to make a Cyrus, which had been
but a particular excellency, as nature might have done; but to
bestow a Cyrus upon the world to make many Cyruses; if they will
learn aright, why, and how, that maker made him.&nbsp; Neither
let it be deemed too saucy a comparison to balance the highest
point of man&rsquo;s wit with the efficacy of nature; but rather
give right honour to the heavenly Maker of that maker, who having
made man to His own likeness, set him beyond and over all the
works of that second nature; which in nothing he showeth so much
as in poetry; when, with the force of a divine breath, he
bringeth things forth surpassing her doings, with no small
arguments to the incredulous of that first accursed fall of Adam;
since our erected wit maketh us know what perfection is, and yet
our infected will keepeth us from reaching unto it.&nbsp; But
these arguments will by few be understood, and by fewer granted;
thus much I hope will be given me, that the Greeks, with some
probability of reason, gave him the name above all names of
learning.</p>
<p>Now <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> let us go to a more ordinary opening of
him, that the truth may be the more palpable; and so, I hope,
though we get not so unmatched a praise as the etymology of his
names will grant, yet his very description, which no man will
deny, shall not justly be barred from a principal
commendation.</p>
<p>Poesy, <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a> therefore, is an art of imitation; for
so Aristotle termeth it in the word
&mu;&#8055;&mu;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;; that is to say, a
representing, counterfeiting, or figuring forth: to speak
metaphorically, a speaking picture, with this end, to teach and
delight.</p>
<p>Of <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> this have been three general kinds: the
<i>chief</i>, both in antiquity and excellency, which they that
did imitate the inconceivable excellencies of God; such were
David in the Psalms; Solomon in the Song of Songs, in his
Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs; Moses and Deborah in their hymns; and
the writer of Job; which, beside others, the learned Emanuel
Tremellius and Fr. Junius do entitle the poetical part of the
scripture; against these none will speak that hath the Holy Ghost
in due holy reverence.&nbsp; In this kind, though in a wrong
divinity, were Orpheus, Amphion, Homer in his hymns, and many
others, both Greeks and Romans.&nbsp; And this poesy must be used
by whosoever will follow St. Paul&rsquo;s counsel, in singing
psalms when they are merry; and I know is used with the fruit of
comfort by some, when, in sorrowful pangs of their death-bringing
sins, they find the consolation of the never-leaving
goodness.</p>
<p>The <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> <i>second</i> kind is of them that deal
with matter philosophical; either moral, as Tyrt&aelig;us,
Phocylides, Cato, or, natural, as Lucretius, Virgil&rsquo;s
Georgics; or astronomical, as Manilius <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> and Pontanus; or historical, as Lucan;
which who mislike, the fault is in their judgment, quite out of
taste, and not in the sweet food of sweetly uttered
knowledge.</p>
<p>But because this second sort is wrapped within the fold of the
proposed subject, and takes not the free course of his own
invention; whether they properly be poets or no, let grammarians
dispute, and go to the <i>third</i>, <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a> indeed right poets,
of whom chiefly this question ariseth; betwixt whom and these
second is such a kind of difference, as betwixt the meaner sort
of painters, who counterfeit only such faces as are set before
them; and the more excellent, who having no law but wit, bestow
that in colours upon you which is fittest for the eye to see; as
the constant, though lamenting look of Lucretia, when she
punished in herself another&rsquo;s fault; wherein he painteth
not Lucretia, whom he never saw, but painteth the outward beauty
of such a virtue.&nbsp; For these three be they which most
properly do imitate to teach and delight; and to imitate, borrow
nothing of what is, hath been, or shall be; but range only,
reined with learned discretion, into the divine consideration of
what may be, and should be.&nbsp; These be they, that, as the
first and most noble sort, may justly be termed
&ldquo;vates;&rdquo; so these are waited on in the excellentest
languages and best understandings, with the fore-described name
of poets.&nbsp; For these, indeed, do merely make to imitate, and
imitate both to delight and teach, and delight to move men to
take that goodness in hand, which, without delight they would fly
as from a stranger; and teach to make them know that goodness
whereunto they are moved; which being the noblest scope to which
ever any learning was directed, yet want there not idle tongues
to bark at them.</p>
<p>These <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> be subdivided into sundry more special
denominations; the most notable be the heroic, lyric, tragic,
comic, satyric, iambic, elegiac, pastoral, and certain others;
some of these being termed according to the matter they deal
with; some by the sort of verse they like best to write in; for,
indeed, the greatest part of poets have apparelled their poetical
inventions in that numerous kind of writing which is called
verse.&nbsp; Indeed, but apparelied verse, being but an ornament,
and no cause to poetry, since there have been many most excellent
poets that never versified, and now swarm many versifiers that
need never answer to the name of poets. <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; For Xenophon, who did imitate so
excellently as to give us <i>effigiem justi imperii</i>, the
portraiture of a just of Cyrus, as Cicero saith of him, made
therein an absolute heroical poem.&nbsp; So did Heliodorus, <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> in his sugared invention of Theagenes
and Chariclea; and yet both these wrote in prose; which I speak
to show, that it is not rhyming and versing that maketh a poet
(no more than a long gown maketh an advocate, who, though he
pleaded in armour should be an advocate and no soldier); but it
is that feigning notable images of virtues, vices, or what else,
with that delightful teaching, which must be the right describing
note to know a poet by.&nbsp; Although, indeed, the senate of
poets have chosen verse as their fittest raiment; meaning, as in
matter they passed all in all, so in manner to go beyond them;
not speaking table-talk fashion, or like men in a dream, words as
they changeably fall from the mouth, but piecing each syllable of
each word by just proportion, according to the dignity of the
subject.</p>
<p>Now, <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> therefore, it shall not be amiss,
first, to weight this latter sort of poetry by his <i>works</i>,
and then by his <i>parts</i>; and if in neither of these
anatomies he be commendable, I hope we shall receive a more
favourable sentence.&nbsp; This purifying of wit, this enriching
of memory, enabling of judgment, and enlarging of conceit, which
commonly we call learning under what name soever it come forth,
or to what immediate end soever it be directed; the final end is,
to lead and draw us to as high a perfection as our degenerate
souls, made worse by, their clay lodgings, <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> can be capable of.&nbsp; This,
according to the inclination of man, bred many formed
impressions; for some that thought this felicity principally to
be gotten by knowledge, and no knowledge to be so high or
heavenly as to be acquainted with the stars, gave themselves to
astronomy; others, persuading themselves to be demi-gods, if they
knew the causes of things, became natural and supernatural
philosophers.&nbsp; Some an admirable delight drew to music, and
some the certainty of demonstrations to the mathematics; but all,
one and other, having this scope to know, and by knowledge to
lift up the mind from the dungeon of the body to the enjoying his
own divine essence.&nbsp; But when, by the balance of experience,
it was found that the astronomer, looking to the stars, might
fall in a ditch; that the enquiring philosopher might be blind in
himself; and the mathematician might draw forth a straight line
with a crooked heart; then lo! did proof, the over-ruler of
opinions, make manifest that all these are but serving sciences,
which, as they have a private end in themselves, so yet are they
all directed to the highest end of the mistress knowledge, by the
Greeks called
&#7936;&rho;&chi;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;,
which stands, as I think, in the knowledge of a man&rsquo;s self;
in the ethic and politic consideration, with the end of well
doing, and not of well knowing only; even as the saddler&rsquo;s
next end is to make a good saddle, but his farther end to serve a
nobler faculty, which is horsemanship; so the horseman&rsquo;s to
soldiery; and the soldier not only to have the skill, but to
perform the practice of a soldier.&nbsp; So that the ending end
of all earthly learning being virtuous action, those skills that
most serve to bring forth that have a most just title to be
princes over all the rest; wherein, if we can show it rightly,
the poet is worthy to have it before any other competitors. <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>Among <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> whom principally to challenge it, step
forth the moral philosophers; whom, methinks, I see coming toward
me with a sullen gravity (as though they could not abide vice by
daylight), rudely clothed, for to witness outwardly their
contempt of outward things, with books in their hands against
glory, whereto they set their names; sophistically speaking
against subtlety, and angry with any man in whom they see the
foul fault of anger.&nbsp; These men, casting largesses as they
go, of definitions, divisions, and distinctions, with a scornful
interrogative do soberly ask: Whether it be possible to find any
path so ready to lead a man to virtue, as that which teacheth
what virtue is; and teacheth it not only by delivering forth his
very being, his causes and effects; but also by making known his
enemy, vice, which must be destroyed; and his cumbersome servant,
passion, which must be mastered, by showing the generalities that
contain it, and the specialities that are derived from it;
lastly, by plain setting down how it extends itself out of the
limits of a man&rsquo;s own little world, to the government of
families, and maintaining of public societies?</p>
<p>The historian <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> scarcely gives leisure to the moralist
to say so much, but that he (laden with old mouse-eaten records,
auth&oacute;rizing <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a> himself, for the most part, upon other
histories, whose greatest authorities are built upon the notable
foundation of hearsay, having much ado to accord differing
writers, and to pick truth out of partiality; better acquainted
with a thousand years ago than with the present age, and yet
better knowing how this world goes than how his own wit runs;
curious for antiquities, and inquisitive of novelties, a wonder
to young folks, and a tyrant in table-talk) denieth, in a great
chafe, that any man for teaching of virtue and virtuous actions,
is comparable to him.&nbsp; I am &ldquo;Testis temporum, lux
veritatis, vita memori&aelig;, magistra vit&aelig;, nuncia
vetustatis.&rdquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; The philosopher, saith he,
teacheth a disputative virtue, but I do an active; his virtue is
excellent in the dangerless academy of Plato, but mine showeth
forth her honourable face in the battles of Marathon, Pharsalia,
Poictiers, and Agincourt: he teacheth virtue by certain abstract
considerations; but I only bid you follow the footing of them
that have gone before you: old-aged experience goeth beyond the
fine-witted philosopher; but I give the experience of many
ages.&nbsp; Lastly, if he make the song book, I put the
learner&rsquo;s hand to the lute; and if he be the guide, I am
the light.&nbsp; Then would he allege you innumerable examples,
confirming story by stories, how much the wisest senators and
princes have been directed by the credit of history, as Brutus,
Alphonsus of Aragon (and who not? if need be).&nbsp; At length,
the long line of their disputation makes a point in this, that
the one giveth the precept, and the other the example.</p>
<p>Now <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> whom shall we find, since the question
standeth for the highest form in the school of learning, to be
moderator?&nbsp; Truly, as me seemeth, the poet; and if not a
moderator, even the man that ought to carry the title from them
both, and much more from all other serving sciences.&nbsp;
Therefore compare we the poet with the historian, and with the
moral philosopher; and if he go beyond them both, no other human
skill can match him; for as for the Divine, with all reverence,
he is ever to be excepted, not only for having his scope as far
beyond any of these, as eternity exceedeth a moment, but even for
passing each of these in themselves; and for the lawyer, though
&ldquo;Jus&rdquo; be the daughter of Justice, the chief of
virtues, yet because he seeks to make men good rather
&ldquo;formidine p&oelig;n&aelig;&rdquo; than &ldquo;virtutis
amore,&rdquo; or, to say righter, doth not endeavour to make men
good, but that their evil hurt not others, having no care, so he
be a good citizen, how bad a man he be: therefore, as our
wickedness maketh him necessary, and necessity maketh him
honourable, so is he not in the deepest truth to stand in rank
with these, who all endeavour to take naughtiness away, and plant
goodness even in the secretest cabinet of our souls.&nbsp; And
these four are all that any way deal in the consideration of
men&rsquo;s manners, which being the supreme knowledge, they that
best breed it deserve the best commendation.</p>
<p>The philosopher, therefore, and the historian are they which
would win the goal, the one by precept, the other by example; but
both, not having both, do both halt.&nbsp; For the philosopher,
setting down with thorny arguments the bare rule, is so hard of
utterance, and so misty to be conceived, that one that hath no
other guide but him shall wade in him until he be old, before he
shall find sufficient cause to be honest.&nbsp; For his knowledge
standeth so upon the abstract and general, that happy is that man
who may understand him, and more happy that can apply what he
doth understand.&nbsp; On the other side the historian, wanting
the precept, is so tied, not to what should be, but to what is;
to the particular truth of things, and not to the general reason
of things; that his example draweth no necessary consequence, and
therefore a less fruitful doctrine.</p>
<p>Now <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> doth the peerless poet perform both;
for whatsoever the philosopher saith should be done, he giveth a
perfect picture of it, by some one by whom he pre-supposeth it
was done, so as he coupleth the general notion with the
particular example.&nbsp; A perfect picture, I say; for he
yieldeth to the powers of the mind an image of that whereof the
philosopher bestoweth but a wordish description, which doth
neither strike, pierce, nor possess the sight of the soul, so
much as that other doth.&nbsp; For as, in outward things, to a
man that had never seen an elephant, or a rhinoceros, who should
tell him most exquisitely all their shape, colour, bigness, and
particular marks? or of a gorgeous palace, an architect, who,
declaring the full beauties, might well make the hearer able to
repeat, as it were, by rote, all he had heard, yet should never
satisfy his inward conceit, with being witness to itself of a
true living knowledge; but the same man, as soon as he might see
those beasts well painted, or that house well in model, should
straightway grow, without need of any description, to a judicial
comprehending of them; so, no doubt, the philosopher, with his
learned definitions, be it of virtue or vices, matters of public
policy or private government, replenisheth the memory with many
infallible grounds of wisdom, which, notwithstanding, lie dark
before the imaginative and judging power, if they be not
illuminated or figured forth by the speaking picture of
poesy.</p>
<p>Tully taketh much pains, and many times not without poetical
help, to make us know the force love of our country hath in
us.&nbsp; Let us but hear old Anchises, speaking in the midst of
Troy&rsquo;s flames, or see Ulysses, in the fulness of all
Calypso&rsquo;s delights, bewail his absence from barren and
beggarly Ithaca.&nbsp; Anger, the Stoics said, was a short
madness; let but Sophocles bring you Ajax on a stage, killing or
whipping sheep and oxen, thinking them the army of Greeks, with
their chieftains Agamemnon and Menelaus; and tell me, if you have
not a more familiar insight into anger, than finding in the
schoolmen his genus and difference?&nbsp; See whether wisdom and
temperance in Ulysses and Diomedes, valour in Achilles,
friendship in Nisus and Euryalus, even to an ignorant man, carry
not an apparent shining; and, contrarily, the remorse of
conscience in &OElig;dipus; the soon-repenting pride in
Agamemnon; the self-devouring cruelty in his father Atreus; the
violence of ambition in the two Theban brothers; the sour
sweetness of revenge in Medea; and, to fall lower, the Terentian
Gnatho, and our Chaucer&rsquo;s Pandar, so expressed, that we now
use their names to signify their trades; and finally, all
virtues, vices, and passions so in their own natural states laid
to the view, that we seem not to hear of them, but clearly to see
through them?</p>
<p>But even in the most excellent determination of goodness, what
philosopher&rsquo;s counsel can so readily direct a prince as the
feigned Cyrus in Xenophon?&nbsp; Or a virtuous man in all
fortunes, as &AElig;neas in Virgil?&nbsp; Or a whole
commonwealth, as the way of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s Utopia?&nbsp;
I say the way, because where Sir Thomas More erred, it was the
fault of the man, and not of the poet; for that way of patterning
a commonwealth was most absolute, though he, perchance, hath not
so absolutely performed it.&nbsp; For the question is, whether
the feigned image of poetry, or the regular instruction of
philosophy, hath the more force in teaching.&nbsp; Wherein, if
the philosophers have more rightly showed themselves
philosophers, than the poets have attained to the high top of
their profession, (as in truth,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mediocribus
esse po&euml;tis<br />
Non D&icirc;, non homines, non concessere column&aelig;,&rdquo;
<a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is, I say again, not the fault of the art, but that by few
men that art can be accomplished.&nbsp; Certainly, even our
Saviour Christ could as well have given the moral common-places
<a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a> of uncharitableness and humbleness, as
the divine narration of Dives and Lazarus; or of disobedience and
mercy, as the heavenly discourse of the lost child and the
gracious father; but that his thorough searching wisdom knew the
estate of Dives burning in hell, and of Lazarus in
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, would more constantly, as it were, inhabit
both the memory and judgment.&nbsp; Truly, for myself (me seems),
I see before mine eyes the lost child&rsquo;s disdainful
prodigality turned to envy a swine&rsquo;s dinner; which, by the
learned divines, are thought not historical acts, but instructing
parables.</p>
<p>For conclusion, I say the philosopher teacheth, but he
teacheth obscurely, so as the learned only can understand him;
that is to say, he teacheth them that are already taught.&nbsp;
But the poet is the food for the tenderest stomachs; the poet is,
indeed, the right popular philosopher.&nbsp; Whereof
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s tales give good proof; whose pretty
allegories, stealing under the formal tales of beasts, make many,
more beastly than beasts, begin to hear the sound of virtue from
those dumb speakers.</p>
<p>But now may it be alleged, that if this managing of matters be
so fit for the imagination, then must the historian needs
surpass, who brings you images of true matters, such as, indeed,
were done, and not such as fantastically or falsely may be
suggested to have been done.&nbsp; Truly, Aristotle himself, in
his Discourse of Poesy, plainly determineth this question,
saying, that poetry is
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#8061;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&pi;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&alpha;&iota;&#8057;&tau;&epsilon;&omicron;&omicron;&nu;,
that is to say, it is more philosophical and more ingenious than
history.&nbsp; His reason is, because poesy dealeth with
&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;, that is
to say, with the universal consideration, and the history
&kappa;&alpha;&theta;
&#7956;&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;, the
particular.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;the
universal weighs what is fit to be said or done, either in
likelihood or necessity; which the poesy considereth in his
imposed names; and the particular only marks, whether Alcibiades
did, or suffered, this or that:&rdquo; thus far Aristotle. <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; Which reason of his, as all his,
is most full of reason.&nbsp; For, indeed, if the question were,
whether it were better to have a particular act truly or falsely
set down? there is no doubt which is to be chosen, no more than
whether you had rather have Vespasian&rsquo;s picture right as he
was, or, at the painter&rsquo;s pleasure, nothing
resembling?&nbsp; But if the question be, for your own use and
learning, whether it be better to have it set down as it should
be, or as it was? then, certainly, is more doctrinable the
feigned Cyrus in Xenophon, than the true Cyrus in Justin; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> and the feigned &AElig;neas in Virgil,
than the right &AElig;neas in Dares Phrygius; <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> as to a lady that desired to fashion
her countenance to the best grace, a painter should more benefit
her, to portrait a most sweet face, writing Canidia upon it, than
to paint Canidia as she was, who, Horace sweareth, was full
ill-favoured.&nbsp; If the poet do his part aright, he will show
you in Tantalus, Atreus, and such like, nothing that is not to be
shunned; in Cyrus, &AElig;neas, Ulysses, each thing to be
followed; where the historian, bound to tell things as things
were, cannot be liberal, without he will be poetical, of a
perfect pattern; but, as in Alexander, or Scipio himself, show
doings, some to be liked, some to be misliked; and then how will
you discern what to follow, but by your own discretion, which you
had, without reading Q. Curtius? <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; And whereas, a
man may say, though in universal consideration of doctrine, the
poet prevaileth, yet that the history, in his saying such a thing
was done, doth warrant a man more in that he shall follow; the
answer is manifest: that if he stand upon that <i>was</i>, as if
he should argue, because it rained yesterday therefore it should
rain to-day; then, indeed, hath it some advantage to a gross
conceit.&nbsp; But if he know an example only enforms a
conjectured likelihood, and so go by reason, the poet doth so far
exceed him, as he is to frame his example to that which is most
reasonable, be it in warlike, politic, or private matters; where
the historian in his bare <i>was</i> hath many times that which
we call fortune to overrule the best wisdom.&nbsp; Many times he
must tell events whereof he can yield no cause; or if he do, it
must be poetically.</p>
<p>For, that a feigned example bath as much force to teach as a
true example (for as for to move, it is clear, since the feigned
may be tuned to the highest key of passion), let us take one
example wherein an historian and a poet did concur.&nbsp;
Herodotus and Justin do both testify, that Zopyrus, King
Darius&rsquo;s faithful servant, seeing his master long resisted
by the rebellious Babylonians, feigned himself in extreme
disgrace of his King; for verifying of which he caused his own
nose and ears to be cut off, and so flying to the Babylonians,
was received; and, for his known valour, so far credited, that he
did find means to deliver them over to Darius.&nbsp; Much-like
matters doth Livy record of Tarquinius and his son.&nbsp;
Xenophon excellently feigned such another stratagem, performed by
Abradatus in Cyrus&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; Now would I fain know,
if occasion be presented unto you to serve your prince by such an
honest dissimulation, why do you not as well learn it of
Xenophon&rsquo;s fiction as of the other&rsquo;s verity? and,
truly, so much the better, as you shall save your nose by the
bargain; for Abradatus did not counterfeit so far.&nbsp; So,
then, the best of the historians is subject to the poet; for,
whatsoever action or faction, whatsoever counsel, policy, or war
stratagem the historian is bound to recite, that may the poet, if
he list, with his imitation, make his own, beautifying it both
for farther teaching, and more delighting, as it please him:
having all, from Dante&rsquo;s heaven to his hell, under the
authority of his pen.&nbsp; Which if I be asked, What poets have
done so? as I might well name some, so yet, say I, and say again,
I speak of the art, and not of the artificer.</p>
<p>Now, to that which commonly is attributed to the praise of
history, in respect of the notable learning which is got by
marking the success, as though therein a man should see virtue
exalted, and vice punished: truly, that commendation is peculiar
to poetry, and far off from history; for, indeed, poetry ever
sets virtue so out in her best colours, making fortune her
well-waiting handmaid, that one must needs be enamoured of
her.&nbsp; Well may you see Ulysses in a storm, and in other hard
plights; but they are but exercises of patience and magnanimity,
to make them shine the more in the near following
prosperity.&nbsp; And, on the contrary part, if evil men come to
the stage, they ever go out (as the tragedy writer answered to
one that misliked the show of such persons) so manacled, as they
little animate folks to follow them.&nbsp; But history being
captive to the truth of a foolish world, in many times a terror
from well-doing, and an encouragement to unbridled
wickedness.&nbsp; For see we not valiant Miltiades rot in his
fetters? the just Phocion and the accomplished Socrates put to
death like traitors? the cruel Severus live prosperously? the
excellent Severus miserably murdered?&nbsp; Sylla and Marius
dying in their beds?&nbsp; Pompey and Cicero slain then when they
would have thought exile a happiness?&nbsp; See we not virtuous
Cato driven to kill himself, and rebel C&aelig;sar so advanced,
that his name yet, after sixteen hundred years, lasteth in the
highest honour?&nbsp; And mark but even C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s own
words of the forenamed Sylla, (who in that only did honestly, to
put down his dishonest tyranny), &ldquo;literas nescivit:&rdquo;
as if want of learning caused him to do well.&nbsp; He meant it
not by poetry, which, not content with earthly plagues, deviseth
new punishment in hell for tyrants: nor yet by philosophy, which
teacheth &ldquo;occidentes esse:&rdquo; but, no doubt, by skill
in history; for that, indeed, can afford you Cypselus, Periander,
Phalaris, Dionysius, and I know not how many more of the same
kennel, that speed well enough in their abominable injustice of
usurpation.</p>
<p>I conclude, therefore, that he excelleth history, not only in
furnishing the mind with knowledge, but in setting it forward to
that which deserves to be called and accounted good: which
setting forward, and moving to well-doing, indeed, setteth the
laurel crowns upon the poets as victorious; not only of the
historian, but over the philosopher, howsoever, in teaching, it
may be questionable.&nbsp; For suppose it be granted, that which
I suppose, with great reason, may be denied, that the
philosopher, in respect of his methodical proceeding, teach more
perfectly than the poet, yet do I think, that no man is so much
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&phi;&iota;&lambda;&#8057;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
as to compare the philosopher in moving with the poet.&nbsp; And
that moving is of a higher degree than teaching, it may by this
appear, that it is well nigh both the cause and effect of
teaching; for who will be taught, if he be not moved with desire
to be taught?&nbsp; And what so much good doth that teaching
bring forth (I speak still of moral doctrine) as that it moveth
one to do that which it doth teach.&nbsp; For, as Aristotle
saith, it is not &gamma;&nu;&#8182;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; but
&pi;&rho;&#8049;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> must be the fruit:
and how &pi;&rho;&#8049;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf; can be, without being
moved to practise, it is no hard matter to consider.&nbsp; The
philosopher showeth you the way, he informeth you of the
particularities, as well of the tediousness of the way and of the
pleasant lodging you shall have when your journey is ended, as of
the many by-turnings that may divert you from your way; but this
is to no man, but to him that will read him, and read him with
attentive, studious painfulness; which constant desire whosoever
hath in him, hath already passed half the hardness of the way,
and therefore is beholden to the philosopher but for the other
half.&nbsp; Nay, truly, learned men have learnedly thought, that
where once reason hath so much over-mastered passion, as that the
mind hath a free desire to do well, the inward light each mind
hath in itself is as good as a philosopher&rsquo;s book: since in
nature we know it is well to do well, and what is well and what
is evil, although not in the words of art which philosophers
bestow upon us; for out of natural conceit the philosophers drew
it; but to be moved to do that which we know, or to be moved with
desire to know, &ldquo;hoc opus, hic labor est.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> therein, of all sciences (I speak still
of human and according to the human conceit), is our poet the
monarch.&nbsp; For he doth not only show the way, but giveth so
sweet a prospect into the way, as will entice any man to enter
into it; nay, he doth, as if your journey should lie through a
fair vineyard, at the very first give you a cluster of grapes,
that full of that taste you may long to pass farther.&nbsp; He
beginneth not with obscure definitions, which must blur the
margin with interpretations, and load the memory with
doubtfulness, but he cometh to you with words set in delightful
proportion, either accompanied with, or prepared for, the
well-enchanting skill of music; and with a tale, forsooth, he
cometh unto you with a tale which holdeth children from play, and
old men from the chimney-corner; <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> and, pretending no
more, doth intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to
virtue; even as the child is often brought to take most wholesome
things, by hiding them in such other as have a pleasant taste;
which, if one should begin to tell them the nature of the aloes
or rhubarbarum they should receive, would sooner take their
physic at their ears than at their mouth; so it is in men (most
of them are childish in the best things, till they be cradled in
their graves); glad they will be to hear the tales of Hercules,
Achilles, Cyrus, &AElig;neas; and hearing them, must needs hear
the right description of wisdom, valour, and justice; which, if
they had been barely (that is to say, philosophically) set out,
they would swear they be brought to school again.&nbsp; That
imitation whereof poetry is, hath the most conveniency to nature
of all other; insomuch that, as Aristotle saith, those things
which in themselves are horrible, as cruel battles, unnatural
monsters, are made, in poetical imitation, delightful.&nbsp;
Truly, I have known men, that even with reading Amadis de Gaule,
which, God knoweth, wanteth much of a perfect poesy, have found
their hearts moved to the exercise of courtesy, liberality, and
especially courage.&nbsp; Who readeth &AElig;neas carrying old
Anchises on his back, that wisheth not it were his fortune to
perform so excellent an act?&nbsp; Whom doth not those words of
Turnus move (the tale of Turnus having planted his image in the
imagination)</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;fugientem
h&aelig;c terra videbit?<br />
Usque adeone mori miserum est?&rdquo; <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the philosophers (as they think) scorn to delight, so
much they be content little to move, saving wrangling whether
&ldquo;virtus&rdquo; be the chief or the only good; whether the
contemplative or the active life do excel; which Plato and
Boetius well knew; and therefore made mistress Philosophy very
often borrow the masking raiment of poesy.&nbsp; For even those
hard-hearted evil men, who think virtue a school-name, and know
no other good but &ldquo;indulgere genio,&rdquo; and therefore
despise the austere admonitions of the philosopher, and feel not
the inward reason they stand upon; yet will be content to be
delighted, which is all the good-fellow poet seems to promise;
and so steal to see the form of goodness, which seen, they cannot
but love, ere themselves be aware, as if they took a medicine of
cherries.</p>
<p>Infinite <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> proofs of the strange effects of this
poetical invention might be alleged; only two shall serve, which
are so often remembered, as, I think, all men know them.&nbsp;
The one of Menenius Agrippa, who, when the whole people of Rome
had resolutely divided themselves from the senate, with apparent
show of utter ruin, though he were, for that time, an excellent
orator, came not among them upon trust, either of figurative
speeches, or cunning insinuations, and much less with far-fetched
maxims of philosophy, which, especially if they were Platonic,
they must have learned geometry before they could have conceived;
but, forsooth, he behaveth himself like a homely and familiar
poet.&nbsp; He telleth them a tale, that there was a time when
all the parts of the body made a mutinous conspiracy against the
belly, which they thought devoured the fruits of each
other&rsquo;s labour; they concluded they would let so
unprofitable a spender starve.&nbsp; In the end, to be short (for
the tale is notorious, and as notorious that it was a tale), with
punishing the belly they plagued themselves.&nbsp; This, applied
by him, wrought such effect in the people as I never read that
only words brought forth; but then so sudden, and so good an
alteration, for upon reasonable conditions a perfect
reconcilement ensued.</p>
<p>The other is of Nathan the prophet, who, when the holy David
had so far forsaken God, as to confirm adultery with murder, when
he was to do the tenderest office of a friend, in laying his own
shame before his eyes, being sent by God to call again so chosen
a servant, how doth he it? but by telling of a man whose beloved
lamb was ungratefully taken from his bosom.&nbsp; The application
most divinely true, but the discourse itself feigned; which made
David (I speak of the second and instrumental cause) as in a
glass see his own filthiness, as that heavenly psalm of mercy
well testifieth.</p>
<p>By these, therefore, examples and reasons, I think it may be
manifest that the poet, with that same hand of delight, doth draw
the mind more effectually than any other art doth.&nbsp; And so a
conclusion not unfitly ensues; that as virtue is the most
excellent resting-place for all worldly learning to make his end
of, so poetry, being the most familiar to teach it, and most
princely to move towards it, in the most excellent work is the
most excellent workman.</p>
<p>But I am content not only to decipher him by his works
(although works in commendation and dispraise must ever hold a
high authority), but more narrowly will examine his parts; so
that (as in a man) though all together may carry a presence full
of majesty and beauty perchance in some one defectious <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a> piece we may find blemish.</p>
<p>Now, <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> in his parts, kinds, or species, as you
list to term them, it is to be noted that some poesies have
coupled together two or three kinds; as the tragical and comical,
whereupon is risen the tragi-comical; some, in the manner, have
mingled prose and verse, as Sannazaro and Boetius; some have
mingled matters heroical and pastoral; but that cometh all to one
in this question; for, if severed they be good, the conjunction
cannot be hurtful.&nbsp; Therefore, perchance, forgetting some,
and leaving some as needless to be remembered, it shall not be
amiss, in a word, to cite the special kinds, to see what faults
may be found in the right use of them.</p>
<p>Is it, then, the pastoral poem which is misliked? <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; For, perchance, where the hedge
is lowest, they will soonest leap over.&nbsp; Is the poor pipe
disdained, which sometimes, out of Melib&aelig;us&rsquo;s mouth,
can show the misery of people under hard lords and ravening
soldiers?&nbsp; And again, by Tityrus, what blessedness is
derived to them that lie lowest from the goodness of them that
sit highest?&nbsp; Sometimes under the pretty tales of wolves and
sheep, can include the whole considerations of wrong doing and
patience; sometimes show, that contentions for trifles can get
but a trifling victory; where, perchance, a man may see that even
Alexander and Darius, when they strove who should be cock of this
world&rsquo;s dunghill, the benefit they got was, that the
after-livers may say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;H&aelig;c memini, et victum frustra
contendere Thyrsim.<br />
Ex illo Corydon, Corydon est tempore nobis.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or is it the lamenting elegiac, <a name="citation48"></a><a
href="#footnote48" class="citation">[48]</a> which, in a kind
heart, would move rather pity than blame; who bewaileth, with the
great philosopher Heraclitus, the weakness of mankind, and the
wretchedness of the world; who, surely, is to be praised, either
for compassionately accompanying just causes of lamentations, or
for rightly pointing out how weak be the passions of
wofulness?</p>
<p>Is it the bitter, but wholesome iambic, <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a> who rubs the galled mind, making shame
the trumpet of villany, with bold and open crying out against
naughtiness?</p>
<p>Or the satiric? who,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Omne vafer vitium ridenti tangit
amico;&rdquo; <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>who sportingly never leaveth, until he make a man laugh at
folly, and, at length, ashamed to laugh at himself, which he
cannot avoid without avoiding the folly; who, while &ldquo;circum
pr&aelig;cordia ludit,&rdquo; giveth us to feel how many
headaches a passionate life bringeth us to; who when all is
done,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Est Ulubris, animus si nos non deficit
&aelig;quus.&rdquo; <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, perchance, it is the comic; <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> whom naughty
play-makers and stage-keepers have justly made odious.&nbsp; To
the arguments of abuse I will after answer; only thus much now is
to be said, that the comedy is an imitation of the common errors
of our life, which he representeth in the most ridiculous and
scornful sort that may be; so as it is impossible that any
beholder can be content to be such a one.&nbsp; Now, as in
geometry, the oblique must be known as well as the right, and in
arithmetic, the odd as well as the even; so in the actions of our
life, who seeth not the filthiness of evil, wanteth a great foil
to perceive the beauty of virtue.&nbsp; This doth the comedy
handle so, in our private and domestical matters, as, with
hearing it, we get, as it were, an experience of what is to be
looked for, of a niggardly Demea, of a crafty Davus, of a
flattering Gnatho, of a vain-glorious Thraso; and not only to
know what effects are to be expected, but to know who be such, by
the signifying badge given them by the comedian.&nbsp; And little
reason hath any man to say, that men learn the evil by seeing it
so set out; since, as I said before, there is no man living, but
by the force truth hath in nature, no sooner seeth these men play
their parts, but wisheth them in &ldquo;pistrinum;&rdquo; <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> although, perchance, the sack of his
own faults lie so behind his back, that he seeth not himself to
dance in the same measure, whereto yet nothing can more open his
eyes than to see his own actions contemptibly set forth; so that
the right use of comedy will, I think, by nobody be blamed.</p>
<p>And much less of the high and excellent tragedy, <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> that openeth the greatest wounds, and
showeth forth the ulcers that are covered with tissue; that
maketh kings fear to be tyrants, and tyrants to manifest their
tyrannical humours; that with stirring the effects of admiration
and commiseration, teacheth the uncertainty of this world, and
upon how weak foundations gilded roofs are builded; that maketh
us know, &ldquo;qui sceptra s&aelig;vus duro imperio regit, timet
timentes, metus in authorem redit.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how much it
can move, Plutarch yielded a notable testimony of the abominable
tyrant Alexander Pher&aelig;us; from whose eyes a tragedy, well
made and represented, drew abundance of tears, who without all
pity had murdered infinite numbers, and some of his own blood; so
as he that was not ashamed to make matters for tragedies, yet
could not resist the sweet violence of a tragedy.&nbsp; And if it
wrought no farther good in him, it was that he, in despite of
himself, withdrew himself from hearkening to that which might
mollify his hardened heart.&nbsp; But it is not the tragedy they
do dislike, for it were too absurd to cast out so excellent a
representation of whatsoever is most worthy to be learned.</p>
<p>Is it the lyric that most displeaseth, who with his tuned lyre
and well-accorded voice, giveth praise, the reward of virtue, to
virtuous acts? who giveth moral precepts and natural problems?
who sometimes raiseth up his voice to the height of the heavens,
in singing the lauds of the immortal God?&nbsp; Certainly, I must
confess mine own barbarousness; I never heard the old song of
Percy and Douglas, that I found not my heart moved more than with
a trumpet; <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a> and yet it is sung but by some blind
crowder, with no rougher voice than rude style; which being so
evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of that uncivil age, what
would it work, trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar?&nbsp;
In Hungary I have seen it the manner at all feasts, and all other
such-like meetings, to have songs of their ancestors&rsquo;
valour, which that right soldier-like nation think one of the
chiefest kindlers of brave courage.&nbsp; The incomparable
Laced&aelig;monians did not only carry that kind of music ever
with them to the field, but even at home, as such songs were
made, so were they all content to be singers of them; when the
lusty men were to tell what they did, the old men what they had
done, and the young what they would do.&nbsp; And where a man may
say that Pindar many times praiseth highly victories of small
moment, rather matters of sport than virtue; as it may be
answered, it was the fault of the poet, and not of the poetry,
so, indeed, the chief fault was in the time and custom of the
Greeks, who set those toys at so high a price, that Philip of
Macedon reckoned a horse-race won at Olympus among three fearful
felicities.&nbsp; But as the inimitable Pindar often did, so is
that kind most capable, and most fit, to awake the thoughts from
the sleep of idleness, to embrace honourable enterprises.</p>
<p>There rests the heroical, <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a> whose very name, I
think, should daunt all backbiters.&nbsp; For by what conceit can
a tongue be directed to speak evil of that which draweth with him
no less champions than Achilles, Cyrus, &AElig;neas, Turus,
Tydeus, Rinaldo? who doth not only teach and move to truth, but
teacheth and moveth to the most high and excellent truth: who
maketh magnanimity and justice shine through all misty
fearfulness and foggy desires? who, if the saying of Plato and
Tully be true, that who could see virtue, would be wonderfully
ravished with the love of her beauty; this man setteth her out to
make her more lovely, in her holiday apparel, to the eye of any
that will deign not to disdain until they understand.&nbsp; But
if any thing be already said in the defence of sweet poetry, all
concurreth to the maintaining the heroical, which is not only a
kind, but the best and most accomplished kind, of poetry.&nbsp;
For, as the image of each action stirreth and instructeth the
mind, so the lofty image of such worthies most inflameth the mind
with desire to be worthy, and informs with counsel how to be
worthy.&nbsp; Only let &AElig;neas be worn in the tablet of your
memory, how he governeth himself in the ruin of his country; in
the preserving his old father, and carrying away his religious
ceremonies; in obeying God&rsquo;s commandments, to leave Dido,
though not only passionate kindness, but even the human
consideration of virtuous gratefulness, would have craved other
of him; how in storms, how in sports, how in war, how in peace,
how a fugitive, how victorious, how besieged, how besieging, how
to strangers, how to allies, how to enemies; how to his own,
lastly, how in his inward self, and how in his outward
government; and I think, in a mind most prejudiced with a
prejudicating humour, he will be found in excellency
fruitful.&nbsp; Yea, as Horace saith, &ldquo;Melius Chrysippo et
Crantore:&rdquo; <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> but, truly, I imagine it falleth out
with these poet-whippers as with some good women who often are
sick, but in faith they cannot tell where.&nbsp; So the name of
poetry is odious to them, but neither his cause nor effects,
neither the sum that contains him, nor the particularities
descending from him, give any fast handle to their carping
dispraise.</p>
<p>Since, then, <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a> poetry is of all human learnings the
most ancient, and of most fatherly antiquity, as from whence
other learnings have taken their beginnings; since it is so
universal that no learned nation doth despise it, nor barbarous
nation is without it; since both Roman and Greek gave such divine
names unto it, the one of prophesying, the other of making, and
that indeed that name of making is fit for him, considering, that
where all other arts retain themselves within their subject, and
receive, as it were, their being from it, the poet only, only
bringeth his own stuff, and doth not learn a conceit out of a
matter, but maketh matter for a conceit; since neither his
description nor end containeth any evil, the thing described
cannot be evil; since his effects be so good as to teach
goodness, and delight the learners of it; since therein (namely,
in moral doctrine, the chief of all knowledges) he doth not only
far pass the historian, but, for instructing, is well nigh
comparable to the philosopher; for moving, leaveth him behind
him; since the Holy Scripture (wherein there is no uncleanness)
hath whole parts in it poetical, and that even our Saviour Christ
vouchsafed to use the flowers of it; since all his kinds are not
only in their united forms, but in their severed dissections
fully commendable; I think, and think I think rightly, the laurel
crown appointed for triumphant captains, doth worthily, of all
other learnings, honour the poet&rsquo;s triumph.</p>
<p>But <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> because we have ears as well as
tongues, and that the lightest reasons that may be, will seem to
weigh greatly, if nothing be put in the counterbalance, let us
hear, and, as well as we can, ponder what objections be made
against this art, which may be worthy either of yielding or
answering.</p>
<p>First, truly, I note, not only in these
&mu;&iota;&sigma;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&omicron;&iota;,
poet-haters, but in all that kind of people who seek a praise by
dispraising others, that they do prodigally spend a great many
wandering words in quips and scoffs, carping and taunting at each
thing, which, by stirring the spleen, may stay the brain from a
thorough beholding, the worthiness of the subject.&nbsp; Those
kind of objections, as they are full of a very idle uneasiness
(since there is nothing of so sacred a majesty, but that an
itching tongue may rub itself upon it), so deserve they no other
answer, but, instead of laughing at the jest, to laugh at the
jester.&nbsp; We know a playing wit can praise the discretion of
an ass, the comfortableness of being in debt, and the jolly
commodities of being sick of the plague; so, of the contrary
side, if we will turn Ovid&rsquo;s verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ut lateat virtus proximitate
mali.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That good lies hid in nearness of the evil,&rdquo;
Agrippa will be as merry in the showing the Vanity of Science, as
Erasmus was in the commending of Folly; <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> neither shall any man or matter escape
some touch of these smiling railers.&nbsp; But for Erasmus and
Agrippa, they had another foundation than the superficial part
would promise.&nbsp; Marry, these other pleasant fault-finders,
who will correct the verb before they understand the noun, and
confute others&rsquo; knowledge before they confirm their own; I
would have them only remember, that scoffing cometh not of
wisdom; so as the best title in true English they get with their
merriments, is to be called good fools; for so have our grave
forefathers ever termed that humorous kind of jesters.</p>
<p>But that which giveth greatest scope to their scorning humour,
is rhyming and versing. <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; It is already
said, and, as I think, truly said, it is not rhyming and versing
that maketh poesy; one may be a poet without versing, and a
versifier without poetry.&nbsp; But yet, presuppose it were
inseparable, as indeed, it seemeth Scaliger judgeth truly, it
were an inseparable commendation; for if &ldquo;oratio&rdquo;
next to &ldquo;ratio,&rdquo; speech next to reason, be the
greatest gift bestowed upon mortality, that cannot be praiseless
which doth most polish that blessing of speech; which considereth
each word, not only as a man may say by his forcible quality, but
by his best measured quantity; carrying even in themselves a
harmony; without, perchance, number, measure, order, proportion
be in our time grown odious.</p>
<p>But lay aside the just praise it hath, by being the only fit
speech for music&mdash;music, I say, the most divine striker of
the senses; thus much is undoubtedly true, that if reading be
foolish without remembering, memory being the only treasure of
knowledge, those words which are fittest for memory, are likewise
most convenient for knowledge.&nbsp; Now, that verse far
exceedeth prose in the knitting up of the memory, the reason is
manifest: the words, besides their delight, which hath a great
affinity to memory, being so set as one cannot be lost, but the
whole work fails: which accusing itself, calleth the remembrance
back to itself, and so most strongly confirmeth it.&nbsp;
Besides, one word so, as it were, begetting another, as, be it in
rhyme or measured verse, by the former a man shall have a near
guess to the follower.&nbsp; Lastly, even they that have taught
the art of memory, have showed nothing so apt for it as a certain
room divided into many places, well and thoroughly known; now
that hath the verse in effect perfectly, every word having his
natural seat, which seat must needs make the word
remembered.&nbsp; But what needs more in a thing so known to all
men?&nbsp; Who is it that ever was a scholar that doth not carry
away some verses of Virgil, Horace, or Cato, which in his youth
he learned, and even to his old age serve him for hourly lessons?
as,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Percontatorem fugito: nam garrulus idem
est.<br />
Dum sibi quisque placet credula turba sumus.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the fitness it hath for memory is notably proved by all
delivery of arts, wherein, for the most part, from grammar to
logic, mathematics, physic, and the rest, the rules chiefly
necessary to be borne away are compiled in verses.&nbsp; So that
verse being in itself sweet and orderly, and being best for
memory, the only handle of knowledge, it must be in jest that any
man can speak against it.</p>
<p>Now <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> then go we to the most important
imputations laid to the poor poets; for aught I can yet learn,
they are these.</p>
<p>First, that there being many other more fruitful knowledges, a
man might better spend his time in them than in this.</p>
<p>Secondly, that it is the mother of lies.</p>
<p>Thirdly, that it is the nurse of abuse, infecting us with many
pestilent desires, with a syren sweetness, drawing the mind to
the serpent&rsquo;s tail of sinful fancies; and herein,
especially, comedies give the largest field to ear, as Chaucer
saith; how, both in other nations and ours, before poets did
soften us, we were full of courage, given to martial exercises,
the pillars of manlike liberty, and not lulled asleep in shady
idleness with poets&rsquo; pastimes.</p>
<p>And lastly and chiefly, they cry out with open mouth, as if
they had overshot Robin Hood, that Plato banished them out of his
commonwealth.&nbsp; Truly this is much, if there be much truth in
it.</p>
<p>First, <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> to the first, that a man might better
spend his time, is a reason indeed; but it doth, as they say, but
&ldquo;petere principium.&rdquo; <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; For if it be,
as I affirm, that no learning is so good as that which teacheth
and moveth to virtue, and that none can both teach and move
thereto so much as poesy, then is the conclusion manifest, that
ink and paper cannot be to a more profitable purpose
employed.&nbsp; And certainly, though a man should grant their
first assumption, it should follow, methinks, very unwillingly,
that good is not good because better is better.&nbsp; But I still
and utterly deny that there is sprung out of earth a more
fruitful knowledge.</p>
<p>To <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> the second, therefore, that they should
be the principal liars, I answer paradoxically, but truly, I
think truly, that of all writers under the sun, the poet is the
least liar; and though he would, as a poet, can scarcely be a
liar.&nbsp; The astronomer, with his cousin the geometrician, can
hardly escape when they take upon them to measure the height of
the stars.&nbsp; How often, think you, do the physicians lie,
when they aver things good for sicknesses, which afterwards send
Charon a great number of souls drowned in a potion before they
come to his ferry.&nbsp; And no less of the rest which take upon
them to affirm.&nbsp; Now for the poet, he nothing affirmeth, and
therefore never lieth; for, as I take it, to lie is to affirm
that to be true which is false: so as the other artists, and
especially the historian, affirmeth many things, can, in the
cloudy knowledge of mankind, hardly escape from many lies: but
the poet, as I said before, never affirmeth; the poet never
maketh any circles about your imagination, to conjure you to
believe for true what he writeth: he citeth not authorities of
other histories, but even for his entry calleth the sweet Muses
to inspire into him a good invention; in troth, not labouring to
tell you what is or is not, but what should or should not
be.&nbsp; And, therefore, though he recount things not true, yet
because he telleth them not for true he lieth not; without we
will say that Nathan lied in his speech, before alleged, to
David; which, as a wicked man durst scarce say, so think I none
so simple would say, that &AElig;sop lied in the tales of his
beasts; for who thinketh that &AElig;sop wrote it for actually
true, were well worthy to have his name chronicled among the
beasts he writeth of.&nbsp; What child is there that cometh to a
play, and seeing Thebes written in great letters upon an old
door, doth believe that it is Thebes?&nbsp; If then a man can
arrive to the child&rsquo;s age, to know that the poet&rsquo;s
persons and doings are but pictures what should be, and not
stories what have been, they will never give the lie to things
not affirmatively, but allegorically and figuratively written;
and therefore, as in history, looking for truth, they may go away
full fraught with falsehood, so in poesy, looking but for
fiction, they shall use the narration but as an imaginative
ground-plot of a profitable invention.</p>
<p>But hereto is replied, that the poets give names to men they
write of, which argueth a conceit of an actual truth, and so, not
being true, proveth a falsehood.&nbsp; And doth the lawyer lie
then, when, under the names of John of the Stile, and John of the
Nokes, he putteth his case?&nbsp; But that is easily answered,
their naming of men is but to make their picture the more lively,
and not to build any history.&nbsp; Painting men, they cannot
leave men nameless; we see we cannot play at chess but that we
must give names to our chess-men: and yet, methinks, he were a
very partial champion of truth that would say we lied for giving
a piece of wood the reverend title of a bishop.&nbsp; The poet
nameth Cyrus and &AElig;neas no other way than to show what men
of their fames, fortunes, and estates should do.</p>
<p>Their <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> third is, how much it abuseth
men&rsquo;s wit, training it to a wanton sinfulness and lustful
love.&nbsp; For, indeed, that is the principal if not only abuse
I can hear alleged.&nbsp; They say the comedies rather teach,
than reprehend, amorous conceits; they say the lyric is larded
with passionate sonnets; the elegiac weeps the want of his
mistress; and that even to the heroical Cupid hath ambitiously
climbed.&nbsp; Alas! Love, I would thou couldst as well defend
thyself, as thou canst offend others!&nbsp; I would those on whom
thou dost attend, could either put thee away or yield good reason
why they keep thee!&nbsp; But grant love of beauty to be a
beastly fault, although it be very hard, since only man, and no
beast, hath that gift to discern beauty; grant that lovely name
of love to deserve all hateful reproaches, although even some of
my masters the philosophers spent a good deal of their lamp-oil
in setting forth the excellency of it; grant, I say, what they
will have granted, that not only love, but lust, but vanity, but,
if they list, scurrility, possess many leaves of the poets&rsquo;
books; yet, think I, when this is granted, they will find their
sentence may, with good manners, put the last words foremost; and
not say that poetry abuseth man&rsquo;s wit, but that man&rsquo;s
wit abuseth poetry.&nbsp; For I will not deny but that
man&rsquo;s wit may make poesy, which should be
&phi;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;, which some
learned have defined, figuring forth good things, to be
&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;,
which doth contrariwise infect the fancy with unworthy objects;
as the painter, who should give to the eye either some excellent
perspective, or some fine picture fit for building or
fortification, or containing in it some notable example, as
Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac, Judith killing Holofernes,
David fighting with Goliath, may leave those, and please an
ill-pleased eye with wanton shows of better-hidden matters.</p>
<p>But, what! shall the abuse of a thing make the right use
odious?&nbsp; Nay, truly, though I yield that poesy may not only
be abused, but that being abused, by the reason of his sweet
charming force, it can do more hurt than any other army of words,
yet shall it be so far from concluding, that the abuse shall give
reproach to the abused, that, contrariwise, it is a good reason,
that whatsoever being abused, doth most harm, being rightly used
(and upon the right use each thing receives his title) doth most
good.&nbsp; Do we not see skill of physic, the best rampire <a
name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a> to our often-assaulted bodies, being
abused, teach poison, the most violent destroyer?&nbsp; Doth not
knowledge of law, whose end is to even and right all things,
being abused, grow the crooked fosterer of horrible
injuries?&nbsp; Doth not (to go in the highest) God&rsquo;s word
abused breed heresy, and His name abused become blasphemy?&nbsp;
Truly, a needle cannot do much hurt, and as truly (with leave of
ladies be it spoken) it cannot do much good.&nbsp; With a sword
thou mayest kill thy father, and with a sword thou mayest defend
thy prince and country; so that, as in their calling poets
fathers of lies, they said nothing, so in this their argument of
abuse, they prove the commendation.</p>
<p>They allege herewith, that before poets began to be in price,
our nation had set their heart&rsquo;s delight upon action, and
not imagination; rather doing things worthy to be written, than
writing things fit to be done.&nbsp; What that before time was, I
think scarcely Sphynx can tell; since no memory is so ancient
that gives not the precedence to poetry.&nbsp; And certain it is,
that, in our plainest homeliness, yet never was the Albion nation
without poetry.&nbsp; Marry, this argument, though it be levelled
against poetry, yet it is indeed a chain-shot against all
learning or bookishness, as they commonly term it.&nbsp; Of such
mind were certain Goths, of whom it is written, that having in
the spoil of a famous city taken a fair library, one hangman,
belike fit to execute the fruits of their wits, who had murdered
a great number of bodies, would have set fire in it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said another, very gravely, &ldquo;take heed
what you do, for while they are busy about those toys, we shall
with more leisure conquer their countries.&rdquo;&nbsp; This,
indeed, is the ordinary doctrine of ignorance, and many words
sometimes I have heard spent in it; but because this reason is
generally against all learning as well as poetry, or rather all
learning but poetry; because it were too large a digression to
handle it, or at least too superfluous, since it is manifest that
all government of action is to be gotten by knowledge, and
knowledge best by gathering many knowledges, which is reading; I
only say with Horace, to him that is of that opinion,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jubeo stultum esse libenter&mdash;&rdquo;
<a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"
class="citation">[69]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>for as for poetry itself, it is the freest from this,
objection, for poetry is the companion of camps.&nbsp; I dare
undertake, Orlando Furioso, or honest King Arthur, will never
displease a soldier: but the quiddity of &ldquo;ens&rdquo; and
&ldquo;prima materia&rdquo; will hardly agree with a
corslet.&nbsp; And, therefore, as I said in the beginning, even
Turks and Tartars are delighted with poets.&nbsp; Homer, a Greek,
flourished before Greece flourished; and if to a slight
conjecture a conjecture may be opposed, truly it may seem, that
as by him their learned men took almost their first light of
knowledge, so their active men receive their first notions of
courage.&nbsp; Only Alexander&rsquo;s example may serve, who by
Plutarch is accounted of such virtue that fortune was not his
guide but his footstool; whose acts speak for him, though
Plutarch did not; indeed, the phoenix of warlike princes.&nbsp;
This Alexander left his schoolmaster, living Aristotle, behind
him, but took dead Homer with him.&nbsp; He put the philosopher
Callisthenes to death, for his seeming philosophical, indeed
mutinous, stubbornness; but the chief thing he was ever heard to
wish for was that Homer had been alive.&nbsp; He well found he
received more bravery of mind by the pattern of Achilles, than by
hearing the definition of fortitude.&nbsp; And, therefore, if
Cato misliked Fulvius for carrying Ennius with him to the field,
it may be answered that if Cato misliked it the noble Fulvius
liked it, or else he had not done it; for it was not the
excellent Cato Uticensis whose authority I would much more have
reverenced, but it was the former, in truth a bitter punisher of
faults, but else a man that had never sacrificed to the
Graces.&nbsp; He misliked, and cried out against, all Greek
learning, and yet, being fourscore years old, began to learn it,
belike fearing that Pluto understood not Latin.&nbsp; Indeed, the
Roman laws allowed no person to be carried to the wars but he
that was in the soldiers&rsquo; roll.&nbsp; And, therefore,
though Cato misliked his unmustered person, he misliked not his
work.&nbsp; And if he had, Scipio Nasica (judged by common
consent the best Roman) loved him: both the other Scipio
brothers, who had by their virtues no less surnames than of Asia
and Afric, so loved him that they caused his body to be buried in
their sepulture.&nbsp; So, as Cato&rsquo;s authority being but
against his person, and that answered with so far greater than
himself, is herein of no validity.</p>
<p>But <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> now, indeed, my burthen is great, that
Plato&rsquo;s name is laid upon me, whom, I must confess, of all
philosophers I have ever esteemed most worthy of reverence; and
with good reason, since of all philosophers he is the most
poetical; yet if he will defile the fountain out of which his
flowing streams have proceeded, let us boldly examine with what
reason he did it.</p>
<p>First, truly, a man might maliciously object that Plato, being
a philosopher, was a natural enemy of poets.&nbsp; For, indeed,
after the philosophers had picked out of the sweet mysteries of
poetry the right discerning of true points of knowledge, they
forthwith, putting it in method, and making a school of art of
that which the poets did only teach by a divine delightfulness,
beginning to spurn at their guides, like ungrateful apprentices,
were not content to set up shop for themselves, but sought by all
means to discredit their masters; which, by the force of delight
being barred them, the less they could overthrow them, the more
they hated them.&nbsp; For, indeed, they found for Homer seven
cities strove who should have him for their citizen, where many
cities banished philosophers as not fit members to live among
them.&nbsp; For only repeating certain of Euripides&rsquo; verses
many Athenians had their lives saved of the Syracusans, where the
Athenians themselves thought many of the philosophers unworthy to
live.&nbsp; Certain poets, as Simonides and Pindar, had so
prevailed with Hiero the First, that of a tyrant they made him a
just king; where Plato could do so little with Dionysius that he
himself, of a philosopher, was made a slave.&nbsp; But who should
do thus, I confess, should requite the objections raised against
poets with like cavillations against philosophers; as likewise
one should do that should bid one read Ph&aelig;drus or Symposium
in Plato, or the discourse of Love in Plutarch, and see whether
any poet do authorise abominable filthiness as they do.</p>
<p>Again, a man might ask, out of what Commonwealth Plato doth
banish them?&nbsp; In sooth, thence where he himself alloweth
community of women.&nbsp; So, as belike this banishment grew not
for effeminate wantonness, since little should poetical sonnets
be hurtful, when a man might have what woman he listed.&nbsp; But
I honour philosophical instructions, and bless the wits which
bred them, so as they be not abused, which is likewise stretched
to poetry.&nbsp; Saint Paul himself sets a watchword upon
philosophy, indeed upon the abuse.&nbsp; So doth Plato upon the
abuse, not upon poetry.&nbsp; Plato found fault that the poets of
his time filled the world with wrong opinions of the gods, making
light tales of that unspotted essence, and therefore would not
have the youth depraved with such opinions.&nbsp; Herein may much
be said; let this suffice: the poets did not induce such
opinions, but did imitate those opinions already induced.&nbsp;
For all the Greek stories can well testify that the very religion
of that time stood upon many and many-fashioned gods; not taught
so by poets, but followed according to their nature of
imitation.&nbsp; Who list may read in Plutarch the discourses of
Isis and Osiris, of the cause why oracles ceased, of the Divine
providence, and see whether the theology of that nation stood not
upon such dreams, which the poets indeed superstitiously
observed; and truly, since they had not the light of Christ, did
much better in it than the philosophers, who, shaking off
superstition, brought in atheism.</p>
<p>Plato, therefore, whose authority I had much rather justly
construe than unjustly resist, meant not in general of poets, in
those words of which Julius Scaliger saith, &ldquo;qua
authoritate, barbari quidam atque insipidi, abuti velint ad
poetas e republic&acirc; exigendos <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a>:&rdquo; but only
meant to drive out those wrong opinions of the Deity, whereof
now, without farther law, Christianity hath taken away all the
hurtful belief, perchance as he thought nourished by then
esteemed poets.&nbsp; And a man need go no farther than to Plato
himself to know his meaning; who, in his dialogue called
&ldquo;Ion,&rdquo; <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> giveth high, and rightly, divine
commendation unto poetry.&nbsp; So as Plato, banishing the abuse,
not the thing, not banishing it, but giving due honour to it,
shall be our patron, and not our adversary.&nbsp; For, indeed, I
had much rather, since truly I may do it, show their mistaking of
Plato, under whose lion&rsquo;s skin they would make an ass-like
braying against poesy, than go about to overthrow his authority;
whom, the wiser a man is, the more just cause he shall find to
have in admiration; especially since he attributeth unto poesy
more than myself do, namely, to be a very inspiring of a divine
force, far above man&rsquo;s wit, as in the fore-named dialogue
is apparent.</p>
<p>Of the other side, who would show the honours have been by the
best sort of judgments granted them, a whole sea of examples
would present themselves; Alexanders, C&aelig;sars, Scipios, all
favourers of poets; L&aelig;lius, called the Roman Socrates,
himself a poet; so as part of Heautontimeroumenos, in Terence,
was supposed to be made by him.&nbsp; And even the Greek
Socrates, whom Apollo confirmed to be the only wise man, is said
to have spent part of his old time in putting &AElig;sop&rsquo;s
Fables into verse; and, therefore, full evil should it become his
scholar Plato to put such words in his master&rsquo;s mouth
against poets. But what needs more?&nbsp; Aristotle writes the
&ldquo;Art of Poesy;&rdquo; and why, if it should not be
written?&nbsp; Plutarch teacheth the use to be gathered of them;
and how, if they should not be read?&nbsp; And who reads
Plutarch&rsquo;s either history or philosophy, shall find he
trimmeth both their garments with guards <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> of poesy.</p>
<p>But I list not to defend poesy with the help of his underling
historiographer.&nbsp; Let it suffice to have showed it is a fit
soil for praise to dwell upon; and what dispraise may be set upon
it is either easily overcome, or transformed into just
commendation.&nbsp; So that since the excellences of it may be so
easily and so justly confirmed, and the low creeping objections
so soon trodden down <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a>; it not being an art
of lies, but of true doctrine; not of effeminateness, but of
notable stirring of courage; not of abusing man&rsquo;s wit, but
of strengthening man&rsquo;s wit; not banished, but honoured by
Plato; let us rather plant more laurels for to ingarland the
poets&rsquo; heads (which honour of being laureate, as besides
them only triumphant captains were, is a sufficient authority to
show the price they ought to be held in) than suffer the
ill-favoured breath of such wrong speakers once to blow upon the
clear springs of poesy.</p>
<p>But <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> since I have run so long a career in
this matter, methinks, before I give my pen a full stop, it shall
be but a little more lost time to inquire, why England, the
mother of excellent minds, should be grown so hard a step-mother
to poets, who certainly in wit ought to pass all others, since
all only proceeds from their wit, being, indeed, makers of
themselves, not takers of others.&nbsp; How can I but
exclaim,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine
l&aelig;so?&rdquo; <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sweet poesy! that hath anciently had kings, emperors,
senators, great captains, such as, besides a thousand others,
David, Adrian, Sophocles, Germanicus, not only to favour poets,
but to be poets; and of our nearer times can present for her
patrons, a Robert, King of Sicily; the great King Francis of
France; King James of Scotland; such cardinals as Bembus and
Bibiena; such famous preachers and teachers as Beza and
Melancthon; so learned philosophers as Fracastorius and Scaliger;
so great orators as Pontanus and Muretus; so piercing wits as
George Buchanan; so grave councillors as, besides many, but
before all, that Hospital <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a> of France, than
whom, I think, that realm never brought forth a more accomplished
judgment more firmly builded upon virtue; I say these, with
numbers of others, not only to read others&rsquo; poesies, but to
poetise for others&rsquo; reading: that poesy, thus embraced in
all other places, should only find in our time a hard welcome in
England, I think the very earth laments it, and therefore decks
our soil with fewer laurels than it was accustomed.&nbsp; For
heretofore poets have in England also flourished; and, which is
to be noted, even in those times when the trumpet of Mars did
sound loudest.&nbsp; And now that an over-faint quietness should
seem to strew the house for poets, they are almost in as good
reputation as the mountebanks at Venice.&nbsp; Truly, even that,
as of the one side it giveth great praise to poesy, which, like
Venus (but to better purpose), had rather be troubled in the net
with Mars, than enjoy the homely quiet of Vulcan; so serveth it
for a piece of a reason why they are less grateful to idle
England, which now can scarce endure the pain of a pen.&nbsp;
Upon this necessarily followeth that base men with servile wits
undertake it, who think it enough if they can be rewarded of the
printer; and so as Epaminondas is said, with the honour of his
virtue, to have made an office by his exercising it, which before
was contemptible, to become highly respected; so these men, no
more but setting their names to it, by their own disgracefulness,
disgrace the most graceful poesy.&nbsp; For now, as if all the
Muses were got with child, to bring forth bastard poets, without
any commission, they do post over the banks of Helicon, until
they make their readers more weary than post-horses; while, in
the meantime, they,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Queis meliore luto finxit pr&aelig;cordia
Titan,&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>are better content to suppress the outflowings of their wit,
than by publishing them to be accounted knights of the same
order.</p>
<p>But I that, before ever I durst aspire unto the dignity, am
admitted into the company of the paper-blurrers, do find the very
true cause of our wanting estimation is want of desert, taking
upon us to be poets in despite of Pallas.&nbsp; Now, wherein we
want desert, were a thankworthy labour to express.&nbsp; But if I
knew, I should have mended myself; but as I never desired the
title so have I neglected the means to come by it; only,
overmastered by some thoughts, I yielded an inky tribute unto
them.&nbsp; Marry, they that delight in poesy itself, should seek
to know what they do, and how they do, especially look themselves
in an unflattering glass of reason, if they be inclinable unto
it.</p>
<p>For poesy must not be drawn by the ears, it must be gently
led, or rather it must lead; which was partly the cause that made
the ancient learned affirm it was a divine, and no human skill,
since all other knowledges lie ready for any that have strength
of wit; a poet no industry can make, if his own genius be not
carried into it.&nbsp; And therefore is an old proverb,
&ldquo;Orator fit, poeta nascitur.&rdquo; <a
name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; Yet confess I always, that as the
fertilest ground must be manured, so must the highest flying wit
have a D&aelig;dalus to guide him.&nbsp; That D&aelig;dalus, they
say, both in this and in other, hath three wings to bear itself
up into the air of due commendation; that is art, imitation, and
exercise.&nbsp; But these, neither artificial rules, nor
imitative patterns, we much cumber ourselves withal.&nbsp;
Exercise, indeed, we do, but that very forebackwardly; for where
we should exercise to know, we exercise as having known; and so
is our brain delivered of much matter which never was begotten by
knowledge.&nbsp; For there being two principal parts, matter to
be expressed by words, and words to express the matter, in
neither we use art or imitation rightly.&nbsp; Our matter is
&ldquo;quodlibet,&rdquo; <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a> indeed, although
wrongly, performing Ovid&rsquo;s verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Quicquid conabor dicere, versus
erit;&rdquo; <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>never marshalling it into any assured rank, that almost the
readers cannot tell where to find themselves.</p>
<p>Chaucer, undoubtedly, did excellently in his Troilus and
Cressida; of whom, truly, I know not whether to marvel more,
either that he in that misty time could see so clearly, or that
we in this clear age go so stumblingly after him.&nbsp; Yet had
he great wants, fit to be forgiven in so reverend
antiquity.&nbsp; I account the Mirror of Magistrates meetly
furnished of beautiful parts.&nbsp; And in the Earl of
Surrey&rsquo;s Lyrics, many things tasting of a noble birth, and
worthy of a noble mind.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Shepherds&rsquo;
Kalendar&rdquo; hath much poesy in his eclogues, indeed, worthy
the reading, if I be not deceived.&nbsp; That same framing of his
<a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a> style to an old rustic language, I dare
not allow; since neither Theocritus in Greek, Virgil in Latin,
nor Sannazaro in Italian, did affect it.&nbsp; Besides these, I
do not remember to have seen but few (to speak boldly) printed
that have poetical sinews in them.&nbsp; For proof whereof, let
but most of the verses be put in prose, and then ask the meaning,
and it will be found that one verse did but beget another,
without ordering at the first what should be at the last; which
becomes a confused mass of words, with a tinkling sound of rhyme,
barely accompanied with reason.</p>
<p>Our <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a> tragedies and comedies, not without
cause, are cried out against, observing rules neither of honest
civility nor skilful poetry.&nbsp; Excepting <i>Gorboduc</i>
(again I say of those that I have seen), which notwithstanding,
as it is full of stately speeches, and well-sounding phrases,
climbing to the height of Seneca his style, and as full of
notable morality, which it does most delightfully teach, and so
obtain the very end of poesy; yet, in truth, it is very
defectuous in the circumstances, which grieves me, because it
might not remain as an exact model of all tragedies.&nbsp; For it
is faulty both in place and time, the two necessary companions of
all corporal actions.&nbsp; For where the stage should always
represent but one place; and the uttermost time presupposed in it
should be, both by Aristotle&rsquo;s precept, and common reason,
but one day; there is both many days and many places
inartificially imagined.</p>
<p>But if it be so in Gorboduc, how much more in all the rest?
where you shall have Asia of the one side, and Afric of the
other, and so many other under kingdoms, that the player, when he
comes in, must ever begin with telling where he is, <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> or else the tale will not be
conceived.&nbsp; Now shall you have three ladies walk to gather
flowers, and then we must believe the stage to be a garden.&nbsp;
By and by, we hear news of shipwreck in the same place, then we
are to blame if we accept it not for a rock.&nbsp; Upon the back
of that comes out a hideous monster with fire and smoke, and then
the miserable beholders are bound to take it for a cave; while,
in the meantime, two armies fly in, represented with four swords
and bucklers, and then, what hard heart will not receive it for a
pitched field?</p>
<p>Now of time they are much more liberal; for ordinary it is,
that two young princes fall in love; after many traverses she is
got with child; delivered of a fair boy; he is lost, groweth a
man, falleth in love, and is ready to get another child; and all
this in two hours&rsquo; space; which, how absurd it is in sense,
even sense may imagine; and art hath taught and all ancient
examples justified, and at this day the ordinary players in Italy
will not err in.&nbsp; Yet will some bring in an example of the
Eunuch in Terence, that containeth matter of two days, yet far
short of twenty years.&nbsp; True it is, and so was it to be
played in two days, and so fitted to the time it set forth.&nbsp;
And though Plautus have in one place done amiss, let us hit it
with him, and not miss with him.&nbsp; But they will say, How
then shall we set forth a story which contains both many places
and many times?&nbsp; And do they not know, that a tragedy is
tied to the laws of poesy, and not of history; not bound to
follow the story, but having liberty either to feign a quite new
matter, or to frame the history to the most tragical
convenience?&nbsp; Again, many things may be told, which cannot
be showed: if they know the difference betwixt reporting and
representing.&nbsp; As for example, I may speak, though I am
here, of Peru, and in speech digress from that to the description
of Calicut; but in action I cannot represent it without
Pacolet&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; And so was the manner the ancients
took by some &ldquo;Nuntius,&rdquo; <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a> to recount things
done in former time, or other place.</p>
<p>Lastly, if they will represent an history, they must not, as
Horace saith, begin &ldquo;ab ovo,&rdquo; <a
name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a> but they must come to the principal
point of that one action which they will represent.&nbsp; By
example this will be best expressed; I have a story of young
Polydorus, delivered, for safety&rsquo;s sake, with great riches,
by his father Priamus to Polymnestor, King of Thrace, in the
Trojan war time.&nbsp; He, after some years, hearing of the
overthrow of Priamus, for to make the treasure his own, murdereth
the child; the body of the child is taken up; Hecuba, she, the
same day, findeth a sleight to be revenged most cruelly of the
tyrant.&nbsp; Where, now, would one of our tragedy-writers begin,
but with the delivery of the child?&nbsp; Then should he sail
over into Thrace, and so spend I know not how many years, and
travel numbers of places.&nbsp; But where doth Euripides?&nbsp;
Even with the finding of the body; leaving the rest to be told by
the spirit of Polydorus.&nbsp; This needs no farther to be
enlarged; the dullest wit may conceive it.</p>
<p>But, besides these gross absurdities, how all their plays be
neither right tragedies nor right comedies, mingling kings and
clowns, not because the matter so carrieth it, but thrust in the
clown by head and shoulders to play a part in majestical matters,
with neither decency nor discretion; so as neither the admiration
and commiseration, nor the right sportfulness, is by their
mongrel tragi-comedy obtained.&nbsp; I know Apuleius did somewhat
so, but that is a thing recounted with space of time, not
represented in one moment: and I know the ancients have one or
two examples of tragi-comedies as Plautus hath Amphytrio.&nbsp;
But, if we mark them well, we shall find, that they never, or
very daintily, match horn-pipes and funerals.&nbsp; So falleth it
out, that having indeed no right comedy in that comical part of
our tragedy, we have nothing but scurrility, unworthy of any
chaste ears; or some extreme show of doltishness, indeed fit to
lift up a loud laughter, and nothing else; where the whole tract
of a comedy should be full of delight; as the tragedy should be
still maintained in a well-raised admiration.</p>
<p>But our comedians think there is no delight without laughter,
which is very wrong; for though laughter may come with delight,
yet cometh it not of delight, as though delight should be the
cause of laughter; but well may one thing breed both
together.&nbsp; Nay, in themselves, they have, as it were, a kind
of contrariety.&nbsp; For delight we scarcely do, but in things
that have a conveniency to ourselves, or to the general
nature.&nbsp; Laughter almost ever cometh of things most
disproportioned to ourselves and nature: delight hath a joy in it
either permanent or present; laughter hath only a scornful
tickling.&nbsp; For example: we are ravished with delight to see
a fair woman, and yet are far from being moved to laughter; we
laugh at deformed creatures, wherein certainly we cannot delight;
we delight in good chances; we laugh at mischances; we delight to
hear the happiness of our friends and country, at which he were
worthy to be laughed at that would laugh: we shall, contrarily,
sometimes laugh to find a matter quite mistaken, and go down the
hill against the bias, <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a> in the mouth of some
such men, as for the respect of them, one shall be heartily
sorrow he cannot choose but laugh, and so is rather pained than
delighted with laughter.&nbsp; Yet deny I not, but that they may
go well together; for, as in Alexander&rsquo;s picture well set
out, we delight without laughter, and in twenty mad antics we
laugh without delight: so in Hercules, painted with his great
beard and furious countenance, in a woman&rsquo;s attire,
spinning at Omphale&rsquo;s commandment, it breeds both delight
and laughter; for the representing of so strange a power in love
procures delight, and the scornfulness of the action stirreth
laughter.</p>
<p>But I speak to this purpose, that all the end of the comical
part be not upon such scornful matters as stir laughter only, but
mix with it that delightful teaching which is the end of
poesy.&nbsp; And the great fault, even in that point of laughter,
and forbidden plainly by Aristotle, is, that they stir laughter
in sinful things, which are rather execrable than ridiculous; or
in miserable, which are rather to be pitied than scorned.&nbsp;
For what is it to make folks gape at a wretched beggar, and a
beggarly clown; or against the law of hospitality, to jest at
strangers, because they speak not English so well as we do? what
do we learn, since it is certain,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nil habet infelix pauperatas durius in
se,<br />
Quam qnod ridiculos, homines facit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But rather a busy loving courtier, and a heartless threatening
Thraso; a self-wise seeming school-master; a wry-transformed
traveller: these, if we saw walk in stage names, which we play
naturally, therein were delightful laughter, and teaching
delightfulness: as in the other, the tragedies of Buchanan <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> do justly bring forth a divine
admiration.</p>
<p>But I have lavished out too many words of this play matter; I
do it, because, as they are excelling parts of poesy, so is there
none so much used in England, and none can be more pitifully
abused; which, like an unmannerly daughter, showing a bad
education, causeth her mother Poesy&rsquo;s honesty to be called
in question.</p>
<p>Other <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> sorts of poetry, almost, have we none,
but that lyrical kind of songs and sonnets, which, if the Lord
gave us so good minds, how well it might be employed, and with
how heavenly fruits, both private and public, in singing the
praises of the immortal beauty, the immortal goodness of that
God, who giveth us hands to write, and wits to conceive; of which
we might well want words, but never matter; of which we could
turn our eyes to nothing, but we should ever have new budding
occasions.</p>
<p>But, truly, many of such writings as come under the banner of
unresistible love, if I were a mistress, would never persuade me
they were in love; so coldly they apply fiery speeches, as men
that had rather read lover&rsquo;s writings, and so caught up
certain swelling phrases, which hang together like a man that
once told me, &ldquo;the wind was at north-west and by
south,&rdquo; because he would be sure to name winds enough; than
that, in truth, they feel those passions, which easily, as I
think, may be bewrayed by the same forcibleness, or
&ldquo;energia&rdquo; (as the Greeks call it), of the
writer.&nbsp; But let this be a sufficient, though short note,
that we miss the right use of the material point of poesy.</p>
<p>Now <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a> for the outside of it, which is words,
or (as I may term it) diction, it is even well worse; so is that
honey-flowing matron eloquence, apparelled, or rather disguised,
in a courtesan-like painted affectation.&nbsp; One time with so
far-fetched words, that many seem monsters, but most seem
strangers to any poor Englishman: another time with coursing of a
letter, as if they were bound to follow the method of a
dictionary: another time with figures and flowers, extremely
winter-starved.</p>
<p>But I would this fault were only peculiar to versifiers, and
had not as large possession among prose printers: and, which is
to be marvelled, among many scholars, and, which is to be pitied,
among some preachers.&nbsp; Truly, I could wish (if at least I
might be so bold to wish, in a thing beyond the reach of my
capacity) the diligent imitators of Tully and Demosthenes, most
worthy to be imitated, did not so much keep Nizolian paper-books
<a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> of their figures and phrases, as by
attentive translation, as it were, devour them whole, and make
them wholly theirs.&nbsp; For now they cast sugar and spice upon
every dish that is served at the table: like those Indians, not
content to wear ear-rings at the fit and natural place of the
ears, but they will thrust jewels through their nose and lips,
because they will be sure to be fine.</p>
<p>Tully, when he was to drive out Catiline, as it were with a
thunderbolt of eloquence, often useth the figure of repetition,
as &ldquo;vivit et vincit, imo in senatum venit, imo in senatum
venit,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; Indeed,
inflamed with a well-grounded rage, he would have his words, as
it were, double out of his mouth; and so do that artificially
which we see men in choler do naturally.&nbsp; And we, having
noted the grace of those words, hale them in sometimes to a
familiar epistle, when it were too much choler to be
choleric.</p>
<p>How well, store of &ldquo;similiter cadences&rdquo; doth sound
with the gravity of the pulpit, I would but invoke
Demosthenes&rsquo; soul to tell, who with a rare daintiness useth
them.&nbsp; Truly, they have made me think of the sophister, that
with too much subtlety would prove two eggs three, and though he
may be counted a sophister, had none for his labour.&nbsp; So
these men bringing in such a kind of eloquence, well may they
obtain an opinion of a seeming fineness, but persuade few, which
should be the end of their fineness.</p>
<p>Now for similitudes in certain printed discourses, I think all
herbalists, all stories of beasts, fowls, and fishes are rifled
up, that they may come in multitudes to wait upon any of our
conceits, which certainly is as absurd a surfeit to the ears as
is possible.&nbsp; For the force of a similitude not being to
prove anything to a contrary disputer, but only to explain to a
willing hearer: when that is done, the rest is a most tedious
prattling, rather overswaying the memory from the purpose whereto
they were applied, than any whit informing the judgment, already
either satisfied, or by similitudes not to be satisfied.</p>
<p>For my part, I do not doubt, when Antonius and Crassus, the
great forefathers of Cicero in eloquence; the one (as Cicero
testifieth of them) pretended not to know art, the other not to
set by it, because with a plain sensibleness they might win
credit of popular ears, which credit is the nearest step to
persuasion (which persuasion is the chief mark of oratory); I do
not doubt, I say, but that they used these knacks very sparingly;
which who doth generally use, any man may see, doth dance to his
own music; and so to be noted by the audience, more careful to
speak curiously than truly.&nbsp; Undoubtedly (at least to my
opinion undoubtedly) I have found in divers small-learned
courtiers a more sound style than in some professors of learning;
of which I can guess no other cause, but that the courtier
following that which by practice he findeth fittest to nature,
therein (though he know it not) doth according to art, though not
by art: where the other, using art to show art, and not hide art
(as in these cases he should do), flieth from nature, and indeed
abuseth art.</p>
<p>But what! methinks I deserve to be pounded <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> for straying from poetry to oratory:
but both have such an affinity in the wordish considerations,
that I think this digression will make my meaning receive the
fuller understanding: which is not to take upon me to teach poets
how they should do, but only finding myself sick among the rest,
to allow some one or two spots of the common infection grown
among the most part of writers; that, acknowledging ourselves
somewhat awry, we may bend to the right use both of matter and
manner: whereto our language giveth us great occasion, being,
indeed, capable of any excellent exercising of it. <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a>&nbsp; I know some will say, it is a
mingled language: and why not so much the better, taking the best
of both the other?&nbsp; Another will say, it wanteth
grammar.&nbsp; Nay, truly, it hath that praise, that it wants not
grammar; for grammar it might have, but needs it not; being so
easy in itself, and so void of those cumbersome differences of
cases, genders, moods, and tenses; which, I think, was a piece of
the tower of Babylon&rsquo;s curse, that a man should be put to
school to learn his mother tongue.&nbsp; But for the uttering
sweetly and properly the conceit of the mind, which is the end of
speech, that hath it equally with any other tongue in the world,
and is particularly happy in compositions of two or three words
together, near the Greek, far beyond the Latin; which is one of
the greatest beauties can be in a language.</p>
<p>Now, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> of versifying there are two sorts, the
one ancient, the other modern; the ancient marked the quantity of
each syllable, and according to that framed his verse; the
modern, observing only number, with some regard of the accent,
the chief life of it standeth in that like sounding of the words,
which we call rhyme.&nbsp; Whether of these be the more
excellent, would bear many speeches; the ancient, no doubt more
fit for music, both words and time observing quantity; and more
fit lively to express divers passions, by the low or lofty sound
of the well-weighed syllable.&nbsp; The latter, likewise, with
his rhyme striketh a certain music to the ear; and, in fine,
since it doth delight, though by another way, it obtaineth the
same purpose; there being in either, sweetness, and wanting in
neither, majesty.&nbsp; Truly the English, before any vulgar
language I know, is fit for both sorts; for, for the ancient, the
Italian is so full of vowels, that it must ever be cumbered with
elisions.&nbsp; The Dutch so, of the other side, with consonants,
that they cannot yield the sweet sliding fit for a verse.&nbsp;
The French, in his whole language, hath not one word that hath
his accent in the last syllable, saving two, called
antepenultima; and little more, hath the Spanish, and therefore
very gracelessly may they use dactiles.&nbsp; The English is
subject to none of these defects.</p>
<p>Now for rhyme, though we do not observe quantity, we observe
the accent very precisely, which other languages either cannot
do, or will not do so absolutely.&nbsp; That
&ldquo;c&aelig;sura,&rdquo; or breathing-place, in the midst of
the verse, neither Italian nor Spanish have, the French and we
never almost fail of.&nbsp; Lastly, even the very rhyme itself
the Italian cannot put in the last syllable, by the French named
the masculine rhyme, but still in the next to the last, which the
French call the female; or the next before that, which the
Italian calls &ldquo;sdrucciola:&rdquo; the example of the former
is, &ldquo;buono,&rdquo; &ldquo;suono;&rdquo; of the sdrucciola
is, &ldquo;femina,&rdquo; &ldquo;semina.&rdquo;&nbsp; The French,
of the other side, hath both the male, as &ldquo;bon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;son,&rdquo; and the female, as &ldquo;plaise,&rdquo;
&ldquo;taise;&rdquo; but the &ldquo;sdrucciola&rdquo; he hath
not; where the English hath all three, as &ldquo;due,&rdquo;
&ldquo;true,&rdquo; &ldquo;father,&rdquo; &ldquo;rather,&rdquo;
&ldquo;motion,&rdquo; &ldquo;potion;&rdquo; with much more which
might be said, but that already I find the trifling of this
discourse is much too much enlarged.</p>
<p>So <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a> that since the ever praiseworthy poesy
is full of virtue, breeding delightfulness, and void of no gift
that ought to be in the noble name of learning; since the blames
laid against it are either false or feeble; since the cause why
it is not esteemed in England is the fault of poet-apes, not
poets; since, lastly, our tongue is most fit to honour poesy, and
to be honoured by poesy; I conjure you all that have had the evil
luck to read this ink-wasting toy of mine, even in the name of
the Nine Muses, no more to scorn the sacred mysteries of poesy;
no more to laugh at the name of poets, as though they were next
inheritors to fools; no more to jest at the reverend title of
&ldquo;a rhymer;&rdquo; but to believe, with Aristotle, that they
were the ancient treasurers of the Grecian&rsquo;s divinity; to
believe, with Bembus, that they were the first bringers in of all
civility; to believe, with Scaliger, that no philosopher&rsquo;s
precepts can sooner make you an honest man, than the reading of
Virgil; to believe, with Clauserus, the translator of Cornutus,
that it pleased the heavenly deity by Hesiod and Homer, under the
veil of fables, to give us all knowledge, logic, rhetoric,
philosophy natural and moral, and &ldquo;quid non?&rdquo; to
believe, with me, that there are many mysteries contained in
poetry, which of purpose were written darkly, lest by profane
wits it should be abused; to believe, with Landin, that they are
so beloved of the gods that whatsoever they write proceeds of a
divine fury.&nbsp; Lastly, to believe themselves, when they tell
you they will make you immortal by their verses.</p>
<p>Thus doing, your names shall flourish in the printers&rsquo;
shops: thus doing, you shall be of kin to many a poetical
preface: thus doing, you shall be most fair, most rich, most
wise, most all: you shall dwell upon superlatives: thus doing,
though you be &ldquo;Libertino patre natus,&rdquo; you shall
suddenly grow &ldquo;Herculea proles,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si quid mea Carmina possunt:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>thus doing, your soul shall be placed with Dante&rsquo;s
Beatrix, or Virgil&rsquo;s Anchisis.</p>
<p>But if (fie of such a but!) you be born so near the
dull-making cataract of Nilus, that you cannot hear the
planet-like music of poetry; if you have so earth-creeping a
mind, that it cannot lift itself up to look to the sky of poetry,
or rather, by a certain rustical disdain, will become such a
Mome, as to be a Momus of poetry; then, though I will not wish
unto you the ass&rsquo;s ears of Midas, nor to be driven by a
poet&rsquo;s verses, as Bubonax was, to hang himself; nor to be
rhymed to death, as is said to be done in Ireland; yet thus much
curse I must send you in the behalf of all poets; that while you
live, you live in love, and never get favour, for lacking skill
of a sonnet; and when you die, your memory die from the earth for
want of an epitaph.</p>

<h3>DISPRAISE OF A COURTLY LIFE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Walking</span> in bright
Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; blaze,<br />
Where with heat oppressed I was,<br />
I got to a shady wood,<br />
Where green leaves did newly bud;<br />
And of grass was plenty dwelling,<br />
Decked with pied flowers sweetly smelling.</p>
<p class="poetry">In this wood a man I met,<br />
On lamenting wholly set;<br />
Ruing change of wonted state,<br />
Whence he was transform&eacute;d late,<br />
Once to shepherds&rsquo; God retaining,<br />
Now in servile court remaining.</p>
<p class="poetry">There he wand&rsquo;ring malecontent,<br />
Up and down perpl&eacute;xed went,<br />
Daring not to tell to me,<br />
Spake unto a senseless tree,<br />
One among the rest electing,<br />
These same words, or this affecting:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;My old mates I grieve to see<br />
Void of me in field to be,<br />
Where we once our lovely sheep<br />
Lovingly like friends did keep;<br />
Oft each other&rsquo;s friendship proving,<br />
Never striving, but in loving.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But may love abiding be<br />
In poor shepherds&rsquo; base degree?<br />
It belongs to such alone<br />
To whom art of love is known:<br />
Seely shepherds are not witting<br />
What in art of love is fitting.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Nay, what need the art to those<br />
To whom we our love disclose?<br />
It is to be us&eacute;d then,<br />
When we do but flatter men:<br />
Friendship true, in heart assured,<br />
Is by Nature&rsquo;s gifts procured.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Therefore shepherds, wanting skill,<br
/>
Can Love&rsquo;s duties best fulfil;<br />
Since they know not how to feign,<br />
Nor with love to cloak disdain,<br />
Like the wiser sort, whose learning<br />
Hides their inward will of harming.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Well was I, while under shade<br />
Oaten reeds me music made,<br />
Striving with my mates in song;<br />
Mixing mirth our songs among.<br />
Greater was the shepherd&rsquo;s treasure<br />
Than this false, fine, courtly pleasure.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where how many creatures be,<br />
So many puffed in mind I see;<br />
Like to Juno&rsquo;s birds of pride,<br />
Scarce each other can abide:<br />
Friends like to black swans appearing,<br />
Sooner these than those in hearing.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Therefore, Pan, if thou may&rsquo;st
be<br />
Made to listen unto me,<br />
Grant, I say, if seely man<br />
May make treaty to god Pan,<br />
That I, without thy denying,<br />
May be still to thee relying.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Only for my two loves&rsquo; sake,<br />
In whose love I pleasure take;<br />
Only two do me delight<br />
With their ever-pleasing sight;<br />
Of all men to thee retaining,<br />
Grant me with those two remaining.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;So shall I to thee always<br />
With my reeds sound mighty praise:<br />
And first lamb that shall befall,<br />
Yearly deck thine altar shall,<br />
If it please thee to be reflected,<br />
And I from thee not rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So I left him in that place,<br />
Taking pity on his case;<br />
Learning this among the rest,<br />
That the mean estate is best;<br />
Better fill&eacute;d with contenting,<br />
Void of wishing and repenting.</p>
<h3>DIRGE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ring</span> out your bells,
let mourning shows be spread,<br />
For Love is dead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All Love is dead, infected<br />
With plague of deep disdain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Worth, as nought worth, rejected,<br />
And faith fair scorn doth gain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From so ungrateful fancy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From such a female frenzy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From them that use men thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Lord, deliver us.</p>
<p class="poetry">Weep, neighbours, weep, do you not hear it
said<br />
That Love is dead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His death-bed, peacock&rsquo;s folly:<br />
His winding-sheet is shame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His will, false-seeming holy,<br />
His sole executor, blame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From so ungrateful fancy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From such a female frenzy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From them that use men thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Lord, deliver us.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let dirge be sung, and trentals rightly
read,<br />
For Love is dead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth<br />
My mistress&rsquo; marble heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which epitaph containeth,<br />
&ldquo;Her eyes were once his dart.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From so ungrateful fancy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From such a female frenzy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From them that use men thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Lord, deliver us.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! I lie: rage hath this error bred;<br />
Love is not dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is not dead, but sleepeth<br />
In her unmatch&eacute;d mind:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where she his counsel keepeth<br />
Till due deserts she find.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore from so vile fancy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To call such wit a frenzy:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who Love can temper thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Lord, deliver us.</p>
<h3>STANZAS TO LOVE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, poor Love, why
dost thou live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to see thy service lost;<br />
If she will no comfort give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make an end, yield up the ghost!</p>
<p class="poetry">That she may, at length, approve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That she hardly long believed,<br />
That the heart will die for love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not in time relieved.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, that ever I was born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Service so to be refused;<br />
Faithful love to be forborn!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Never love was so abused.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, sweet Love, be still awhile;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She that hurt thee, Love, may heal thee;<br />
Sweet!&nbsp; I see within her smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than reason can reveal thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">For, though she be rich and fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet she is both wise and kind,<br />
And, therefore, do thou not despair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thy faith may fancy find.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet, although she be a queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That may such a snake despise,<br />
Yet, with silence all unseen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Run, and hide thee in her eyes:</p>
<p class="poetry">Where if she will let thee die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet at latest gasp of breath,<br />
Say that in a lady&rsquo;s eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love both took his life and death.</p>
<h3>A REMEDY FOR LOVE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Philoclea</span> and Pamela
sweet,<br />
By chance, in one great house did meet;<br />
And meeting, did so join in heart,<br />
That th&rsquo; one from th&rsquo; other could not part:<br />
And who indeed (not made of stones)<br />
Would separate such lovely ones?<br />
The one is beautiful, and fair<br />
As orient pearls and rubies are;<br />
And sweet as, after gentle showers,<br />
The breath is of some thousand flowers:<br />
For due proportion, such an air<br />
Circles the other, and so fair,<br />
That it her brownness beautifies,<br />
And doth enchant the wisest eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not seen, on some
great day,<br />
Two goodly horses, white and bay,<br />
Which were so beauteous in their pride,<br />
You knew not which to choose or ride?<br />
Such are these two; you scarce can tell,<br />
Which is the daintier bonny belle;<br />
And they are such, as, by my troth,<br />
I had been sick with love of both,<br />
And might have sadly said, &lsquo;Good-night<br />
Discretion and good fortune quite;&rsquo;<br />
But that young Cupid, my old master,<br />
Presented me a sovereign plaster:<br />
Mopsa! ev&rsquo;n Mopsa! (precious pet)<br />
Whose lips of marble, teeth of jet,<br />
Are spells and charms of strong defence,<br />
To conjure down concupiscence.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How oft have I been reft of
sense,<br />
By gazing on their excellence,<br />
But meeting Mopsa in my way,<br />
And looking on her face of clay,<br />
Been healed, and cured, and made as sound,<br />
As though I ne&rsquo;er had had a wound?<br />
And when in tables of my heart,<br />
Love wrought such things as bred my smart,<br />
Mopsa would come, with face of clout,<br />
And in an instant wipe them out.<br />
And when their faces made me sick,<br />
Mopsa would come, with face of brick,<br />
A little heated in the fire,<br />
And break the neck of my desire.<br />
Now from their face I turn mine eyes,<br />
But (cruel panthers!) they surprise<br />
Me with their breath, that incense sweet,<br />
Which only for the gods is meet,<br />
And jointly from them doth respire,<br />
Like both the Indies set on fire:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which so o&rsquo;ercomes
man&rsquo;s ravished sense,<br />
That souls, to follow it, fly hence.<br />
No such-like smell you if you range<br />
To th&rsquo; Stocks, or Cornhill&rsquo;s square Exchange;<br />
There stood I still as any stock,<br />
Till Mopsa, with her puddle dock,<br />
Her compound or electuary,<br />
Made of old ling and young canary,<br />
Bloat-herring, cheese, and voided physic,<br />
Being somewhat troubled with a phthisic,<br />
Did cough, and fetch a sigh so deep,<br />
As did her very bottom sweep:<br />
Whereby to all she did impart,<br />
How love lay rankling at her heart:<br />
Which, when I smelt, desire was slain,<br />
And they breathed forth perfumes in vain.<br />
Their angel voice surprised me now;<br />
But Mopsa, her Too-whit, Too-whoo,<br />
Descending through her oboe nose,<br />
Did that distemper soon compose.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, therefore, O thou
precious owl,<br />
The wise Minerva&rsquo;s only fowl;<br />
What, at thy shrine, shall I devise<br />
To offer up a sacrifice?<br />
Hang &AElig;sculapius, and Apollo,<br />
And Ovid, with his precious shallow.<br />
Mopsa is love&rsquo;s best medicine,<br />
True water to a lover&rsquo;s wine.<br />
Nay, she&rsquo;s the yellow antidote,<br />
Both bred and born to cut Love&rsquo;s throat:<br />
Be but my second, and stand by,<br />
Mopsa, and I&rsquo;ll them both defy;<br />
And all else of those gallant races,<br />
Who wear infection in their faces;<br />
For thy face (that Medusa&rsquo;s shield!)<br />
Will bring me safe out of the field.</p>

<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">fair</span>! O sweet!

Heart and soul do sing in me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This you hear is not my tongue,<br />
Which once said what I conceived;<br />
For it was of use bereaved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cruel answer stung.<br />
No! though tongue to roof be cleaved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fearing lest he chastised be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart and soul do sing in me.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fair! O sweet! when I do look on thee,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Just accord all music makes;<br />
In thee just accord excelleth,<br />
Where each part in such peace dwelleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One of other beauty takes.<br />
Since then truth to all minds telleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in thee lives harmony,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart and soul do sing in me.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fair! O sweet! when I do look on thee,<br />

So then since that heaven remaineth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In thy face, I plainly see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart and soul do sing in me.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fair! O sweet! when I do look on thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In whom all joys so well agree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet, think not I am at ease,<br />
For because my chief part singeth;<br />
This song from death&rsquo;s sorrow springeth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As to swan in last disease:<br />
For no dumbness, nor death, bringeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay to true love&rsquo;s melody:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart and soul do sing in me.</p>

<h3>A SONNET BY SIR EDWARD DYER.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Prometheus</span>, when
first from heaven high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought down fire, till then on earth not
seen;<br />
Fond of delight, a satyr, standing by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave it a kiss, as it like sweet had been.</p>
<p class="poetry">Feeling forthwith the other burning power,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wood with the smart, with shouts and shrieking
shrill,<br />
He sought his ease in river, field, and bower;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for the time, his grief went with him
still.</p>
<p class="poetry">So silly I, with that unwonted sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In human shape an angel from above,<br />
Feeding mine eyes, th&rsquo; impression there did light;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That since I run and rest as pleaseth love:<br />
The difference is, the satyr&rsquo;s lips, my heart,<br />
He for a while, I evermore, have smart.</p>
<h3>SIR PHILIP SIDNEY&rsquo;S SONNET IN REPLY.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <span
class="smcap">satyr</span> once did run away for dread,<br />
With sound of horn which he himself did blow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fearing and feared, thus from himself he fled,<br />
Deeming strange evil in that he did not know.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such causeless fears when
coward minds do take,<br />
It makes them fly that which they fain would have;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As this poor beast, who did his rest forsake,<br />
Thinking not why, but how, himself to save.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ev&rsquo;n thus might I, for
doubts which I conceive<br />
Of mine own words, my own good hap betray;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus might I, for fear of may be, leave<br />
The sweet pursuit of my desir&eacute;d prey.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Better like I thy satyr, dearest Dyer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who burnt his lips to kiss fair shining fire.</p>
<h3>MUST LOVE LAMENT?</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> mistress lowers,
and saith I do not love:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I do protest, and seek with service due,<br />
In humble mind, a constant faith to prove;<br />
But for all this, I cannot her remove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From deep vain thought that I may not be true.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If oaths might serve,
ev&rsquo;n by the Stygian lake,<br />
Which poets say the gods themselves do fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never did my vow&eacute;d word forsake:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For why should I, whom free choice slave doth
make,<br />
Else-what in face, than in my fancy bear?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Muse, therefore, for only
thou canst tell,<br />
Tell me the cause of this my causeless woe?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell, how ill thought disgraced my doing well?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell, how my joys and hopes thus foully fell<br />
To so low ebb that wonted were to flow?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O this it is, the knotted
straw is found;<br />
In tender hearts, small things engender hate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A horse&rsquo;s worth laid waste the Trojan
ground;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A three-foot stool in Greece made trumpets sound;<br
/>
An ass&rsquo;s shade e&rsquo;er now hath bred debate.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Greeks themselves were
moved with so small cause,<br />
To twist those broils, which hardly would untwine:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should ladies fair be tied to such hard laws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in their moods to take a ling&rsquo;ring
pause?<br />
I would it not, their metal is too fine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand doth not bear witness
with my heart,<br />
She saith, because I make no woeful lays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To paint my living death and endless smart:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, for one that felt god Cupid&rsquo;s dart,<br
/>
She thinks I lead and live too merry days.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are poets then the only
lovers true,<br />
Whose hearts are set on measuring a verse?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who think themselves well blest, if they renew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some good old dump that Chaucer&rsquo;s mistress
knew;<br />
And use but you for matters to rehearse.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, good Apollo, do away
thy bow:<br />
Take harp and sing in this our versing time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my brain some sacred humour flow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all the earth my woes, sighs, tears may
know;<br />
And see you not that I fall low to rhyme.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my mirth, how could I
but be glad,<br />
Whilst that methought I justly made my boast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That only I the only mistress had?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, if e&rsquo;er my face with joy be clad,<br
/>
Think Hannibal did laugh when Carthage lost.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet lady, as for those
whose sullen cheer,<br />
Compared to me, made me in lightness sound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, stoic-like, in cloudy hue appear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who silence force to make their words more dear;<br
/>
Whose eyes seem chaste, because they look on ground:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe them not, for physic
true doth find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Choler adust is joyed in woman-kind.</p>
<h3>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TWO SHEPHERDS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Uttered in a Pastoral Show at
Wilton</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Dick, since we cannot dance,
come, let a cheerful voice<br />
Show that we do not grudge at all when others do rejoice.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Ah Will, though I grudge
not, I count it feeble glee,<br />
With sight made dim with daily tears another&rsquo;s sport to
see.<br />
Whoever lambkins saw, yet lambkins love to play,<br />
To play when that their lov&eacute;d dams are stolen or gone
astray?<br />
If this in them be true, as true in men think I,<br />
A lustless song forsooth thinks he that hath more lust to
cry.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; A time there is for all, my
mother often says,<br />
When she, with skirts tucked very high, with girls at football
plays<br />
When thou hast mind to weep, seek out some smoky room:<br />
Now let those lightsome sights we see thy darkness overcome.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; What joy the joyful sun
gives unto blear&eacute;d eyes;<br />
That comfort in these sports you like, my mind his comfort
tries.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Is thy bagpipe
broke, or are thy lambs miswent;<br />
Thy wallet or thy tar-box lost; or thy new raiment-rent?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; I would it were but thus,
for thus it were too well.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Thou see&rsquo;st my ears do
itch at it: good Dick thy sorrow tell.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Hear then, and learn to
sigh: a mistress I do serve,<br />
Whose wages make me beg the more, who feeds me till I starve;<br
/>
Whose livery is such, as most I freeze apparelled most,<br />
And looks so near unto my cure, that I must needs be lost.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; These are
riddles sure: art thou then bound to her?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Bound as I neither power
have, nor would have power, to stir.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Who bound thee?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Love, my lord.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What witnesses thereto?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Faith in myself, and Worth
in her, which no proof can undo.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What seal?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; My heart deep graven.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Who made the band so
fast?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Wonder that, by two so black
eyes the glitt&rsquo;ring stars be past.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What keepeth safe thy
band?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Remembrance is the chest<br
/>
Lock&rsquo;d fast with knowing that she is of worldly things the
best.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Thou late of wages
plain&rsquo;dst: what wages may&rsquo;sh thou have?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Her heavenly looks, which
more and more do give me cause to crave.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; If wages make you want, what
food is that she gives?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Tear&rsquo;s drink,
sorrow&rsquo;s meat, wherewith not I, but in me my death
lives.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What living get you
then?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Disdain; but just
disdain;<br />
So have I cause myself to plain, but no cause to complain.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; What care takes she for
thee?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Her care is to prevent<br />
My freedom, with show of her beams, with virtue, my content.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; God shield us from such
dames!&nbsp; If so our dames be sped,<br />
The shepherds will grow lean I trow, their sheep will be
ill-fed.<br />
But Dick, my counsel mark: run from the place of woo:<br />
The arrow being shot from far doth give the smaller blow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Good Will, I cannot take thy
good advice; before<br />
That foxes leave to steal, they find they die therefore.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will</i>.&nbsp; Then, Dick, let us go hence
lest we great folks annoy:<br />
For nothing can more tedious be than plaint in time of joy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Dick</i>.&nbsp; Oh hence!&nbsp; O cruel
word! which even dogs do hate:<br />
But hence, even hence, I must needs go; such is my dogged
fate.</p>

End the way, where all men stay.&nbsp; No, no, no, no.</p>

And in whom fair death proceedeth,<br />
Glory breedeth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I, in her beams dying,<br />

<p><i>From</i> &ldquo;<i>La Diana de Monte-Mayor</i>,&rdquo;
<i>in Spanish</i>: <i>where Sireno</i>, <i>a shepherd</i>,
<i>whose mistress Diana had utterly forsaken him</i>, <i>pulling
out a little of her hair</i>, <i>wrapped about with green
silk</i>, <i>to the hair he thus bewailed himself</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> changes here, O
hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see, since I saw you!<br />
How ill fits you this green to wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For hope, the colour due!<br />
Indeed, I well did hope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though hope were mixed with fear,<br />
No other shepherd should have scope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once to approach this hair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah hair! how many days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Dian made me show,<br />
With thousand pretty childish plays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I ware you or no:<br />
Alas, how oft with tears,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O tears of guileful breast!&mdash;<br />
She seem&eacute;d full of jealous fears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereat I did but jest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tell me, O hair of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I then faulty be,<br />
That trust those killing eyes I would,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they did warrant me?<br />
Have you not seen her mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What streams of tears she spent,<br />
&rsquo;Till that I sware my faith so stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As her words had it bent?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who hath such beauty seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In one that changeth so?<br />
Or where one&rsquo;s love so constant been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who ever saw such woe?<br />
Ah, hair! are you not grieved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come from whence you be,<br />
Seeing how once you saw I lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see me as you see?</p>
<p class="poetry">On sandy bank of late,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw this woman sit;<br />
Where, &ldquo;Sooner die than change my state,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She with her finger writ:<br />
Thus my belief was staid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold Love&rsquo;s mighty hand<br />
On things were by a woman said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And written in the sand.</p>
<p><i>The same Sireno in</i> &ldquo;<i>Monte-Mayor</i>,&rdquo;
<i>holding his mistress&rsquo;s glass before her</i>, <i>and
looking upon her while she viewed herself</i>, <i>thus
sang</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Of this high grace, with bliss conjoined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No farther debt on me is laid,<br />
Since that in self-same metal coined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet lady, you remain well paid;</p>
<p class="poetry">For if my place give me great pleasure,<br />
Having before my nature&rsquo;s treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In face and eyes unmatch&eacute;d being,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the same in my hands, seeing<br />
What in your face mine eyes do measure.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor think the match unevenly made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That of those beams in you do tarry,<br />
The glass to you but gives a shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me mine eyes the true shape carry;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such a thought most highly
prized,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which ever hath Love&rsquo;s yoke
despised,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Better than one captived perceiveth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he the lively form receiveth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other sees it but
disguised.</p>
<h3>SONNETS.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> dart, the beams,

That of the stroke, the heat, and knot of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wounded, inflamed, knit to the death, I die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hardened and cold, far from affection&rsquo;s
snare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was once my mind, my temper, and my life;<br />
While I that sight, desire, and vow forbare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to avoid, quench, lose, nought boasted
strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet will not I grief, ashes, thraldom change<br

So brave a shot, dear fire, and beauty strange,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid me pierce, burn, and bind, long time and

And in my wounds, my flames, and bonds, I find<br />
A salve, fresh air, and bright contented mind.</p>

<p class="poetry">Thus honour, liking, trust, much, far, and

kill,</p>
<p class="poetry">Then grief, unkindness, proof, took, kindled,

<h3>WOOING-STUFF.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Faint</span> amorist, what,
dost thou think<br />
To taste Love&rsquo;s honey, and not drink<br />
One dram of gall? or to devour<br />
A world of sweet, and taste no sour?<br />
Dost thou ever think to enter<br />
Th&rsquo; Elysian fields, that dar&rsquo;st not venture<br />
In Charon&rsquo;s barge? a lover&rsquo;s mind<br />
Must use to sail with every wind.<br />
He that loves and fears to try,<br />
Learns his mistress to deny.<br />
Doth she chide thee? &rsquo;tis to show it,<br />
That thy coldness makes her do it:<br />
Is she silent? is she mute?<br />
Silence fully grants thy suit:<br />
Doth she pout, and leave the room?<br />
Then she goes to bid thee come:<br />
Is she sick? why then be sure,<br />
She invites thee to the cure:<br />
Doth she cross thy suit with &ldquo;No?&rdquo;<br />
Tush, she loves to hear thee woo:<br />
Doth she call the faith of man<br />
In question?&nbsp; Nay, she loves thee than;<br />
And if e&rsquo;er she makes a blot,<br />
She&rsquo;s lost if that thou hit&rsquo;st her not.<br />
He that after ten denials,<br />
Dares attempt no farther trials,<br />
Hath no warrant to acquire<br />
The dainties of his chaste desire.</p>
<h3>SONNETS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Since</span> shunning pain,
I ease can never find;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since bashful dread seeks where he knows me
harmed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since will is won, and stopp&eacute;d ears are
charmed;<br />
Since force doth faint, and sight doth make me blind;<br />
Since loosing long, the faster still I bind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since naked sense can conquer reason armed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since heart, in chilling fear, with ice is
warmed;<br />
In fine, since strife of thought but mars the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I yield, O Love, unto thy loathed yoke,<br />
Yet craving law of arms, whose rule doth teach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, hardly used, who ever prison broke,<br />
In justice quit, of honour made no breach:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas, if I a grateful guardian have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art my lord, and I thy vow&eacute;d slave.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Love puffed up with rage of high
disdain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved to make me pattern of his might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like foe, whose wits inclined to deadly spite,<br />
Would often kill, to breed more feeling pain;<br />
He would not, armed with beauty, only reign<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On those affects which easily yield to sight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But virtue sets so high, that reason&rsquo;s
light,<br />
For all his strife can only bondage gain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I live to pay a mortal fee,<br />
Dead palsy-sick of all my chiefest parts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those whom dreams make ugly monsters see,<br />
And can cry help with naught but groans and starts:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Longing to have, having no wit to wish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To starving minds such is god Cupid&rsquo;s
dish.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And mournfully bewailing,<br />
Her throat in tunes expresseth<br />
What grief her breast oppresseth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Tereus&rsquo; force on her chaste will
prevailing.<br />
O Philomela fair!&nbsp; O take some gladness,<br />

But Tereus&rsquo; love, on her by strong hand wroken,<br />

Full womanlike, complains her will was broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I, who daily craving,<br />
Cannot have to content me,<br />
Have more cause to lament me,<br />

Late harbours in her face, whom Nature wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As treasure-house where her best gifts do bide;<br

And so by privilege of sacred seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A seat where beauty shines and virtue reigns,<br />
He hopes for some small praise, since she hath great,<br />

I praised her eyes, whom never chance doth move;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her breath, which makes a sour answer sweet;<br />
Her milken breasts, the nurse of child-like love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her legs, O legs! her aye well-stepping feet:<br />
Pain heard her praise, and full of inward fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (First sealing up my heart as prey of his)<br />
He flies to her, and, boldened with desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face, this age&rsquo;s praise, the thief doth
kiss.<br />
O Pain!&nbsp; I now recant the praise I gave,<br />
And swear she is not worthy thee to have.</p>

Whom cursed do bless; whose weakness virtues arm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who others&rsquo; woes and plaints can chastely
bear:<br />
In whose sweet heaven angels of high thoughts swarm?<br />

Fear&rsquo;st not a face that oft whole hearts devours?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or art thou from above bid play this part,<br />
And so no help &rsquo;gainst envy of those powers?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thus, alas, yet while those parts have woe;<br />

&ldquo;O cruel pain!&rdquo;<br />
And doth she know what mould her beauty bears?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mourns she in truth, and thinks that others

Fears she to feel, and feels not others&rsquo; fears?<br />
Or doth she think all pain the mind forbears?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That heavy earth, not fiery spirits, may plain?<br

That eyes weep worse than heart in bloody tears?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sense feels more than what doth sense
contain?<br />
No, no, she is too wise, she knows her face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath not such pain as it makes others have:<br />
She knows the sickness of that perfect place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath yet such health, as it my life can save.<br />
But this, she thinks, our pain high cause excuseth,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor held in evil, nor suffered to be sound.<br />
But with his wings of fancies up he goes,<br />

The rocks, which were of constant mind the mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In climbing steep, now hard refusal show;<br />
The shading woods seem now my sun to dark,<br />

common-places</i>.&nbsp; Common Place, &ldquo;Locus
communis,&rdquo; was a term used in old rhetoric to represent
testimonies or pithy sentences of good authors which might be
used for strengthening or adorning a discourse; but said
Keckermann, whose Rhetoric was a text-book in the days of James
I. and Charles I., &ldquo;Because it is impossible thus to read
through all authors, there are books that give students of
eloquence what they need in the succinct form of books of Common
Places, like that collected by Stob&aelig;us out of Cicero,
Seneca, Terence, Aristotle; but especially the book entitled
&lsquo;Polyanthea,&rsquo; provides short and effective sentences
apt to any matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frequent resort to the Polyanthea
caused many a good quotation to be hackneyed; the term of
rhetoric, &ldquo;a common-place,&rdquo; came then to mean a good
saying made familiar by incessant quoting, and then in common
speech, any trite saying good or bad, but commonly without wit in
it.</p>

The whole passage in the &ldquo;Poetics&rdquo; runs: &ldquo;It is
not by writing in verse or prose that the Historian and Poet are
distinguished.&nbsp; The work of Herodotus might be versified;
but it would still be a species of History, no less with metre
than without.&nbsp; They are distinguished by this, that the one
relates what has been, the other what might be.&nbsp; On this
account Poetry is more philosophical, and a more excellent thing
than History, for Poetry is chiefly conversant about general
truth; History about particular.&nbsp; In what manner, for
example, any person of a certain character would speak or act,
probably or necessarily, this is general; and this is the object
of Poetry, even while it makes use of particular names.&nbsp; But
what Alcibiades did, or what happened to him, this is particular
truth.&rdquo;</p>

Horace&rsquo;s epistles (Lib. 1):</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At Ulubr&aelig;&rdquo; was equivalent to saying in the
dullest corner of the world, or anywhere.&nbsp; Ulubr&aelig; was
a little town probably in Campania, a Roman Little
Pedlington.&nbsp; Thomas Carlyle may have had this passage in
mind when he gave to the same thought a grander form in Sartor
Resartus: &ldquo;May we not say that the hour of spiritual
enfranchisement is even this?&nbsp; When your ideal world,
wherein the whole man has been dimly struggling and inexpressibly
languishing to work, becomes revealed and thrown open, and you
discover with amazement enough, like the Lothario in Wilhelm
Meister, that your America is here or nowhere.&nbsp; The
situation that has not its duty, its ideal, was never occupied by
man.&nbsp; Yes, here, in this poor, miserable hampered actual
wherein thou even now standest, here or nowhere, is thy Ideal:
work it out therefrom, believe, live, and be free.&nbsp; Fool!
the Ideal is in thyself, the impediment too is in thyself.&nbsp;
Thy condition is but the stuff thou art to shape that same Ideal
out of.&nbsp; What matter whether such stuff be of this sort or
that, so the form thou give it be heroic, be poetic?&nbsp; O thou
that pinest in the imprisonment of the actual, and criest
bitterly to the gods for a kingdom wherein to rule and create,
know this of a truth, the thing thou seekest is already with
thee, here or nowhere, couldest thou only see.&rdquo;</p>

with Socrates, who cannot understand why it is that his thoughts
flow abundantly when he talks of Homer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
explain,&rdquo; says Socrates; &ldquo;your talent in expounding
Homer is not an art acquired by system and method, otherwise it
would have been applicable to other poets besides.&nbsp; It is a
special gift, imparted to you by Divine power and
inspiration.&nbsp; The like is true of the poet you
expound.&nbsp; His genius does not spring from art, system, or
method: it is a special gift emanating from the inspiration of
the Muses.&nbsp; A poet is light, airy, holy person, who cannot
compose verses at all so long as his reason remains within
him.&nbsp; The Muses take away his reason, substituting in place
of it their own divine inspiration and special impulse . . . Like
prophets and deliverers of oracles, these poets have their reason
taken away, and become the servants of the gods.&nbsp; It is not
they who, bereft of their reason, speak in such sublime strains,
it is the god who speaks to us, and speaks through
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; George Grote, from whose volumes on Plato I

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
